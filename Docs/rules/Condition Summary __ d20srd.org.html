<h1>Condition Summary</h1>
<p>
	If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects canâ€™t combine, apply the most severe effect.
</p>

<h2 id="abilityDamaged">Ability Damaged</h2>
<p>
	The character has temporarily lost 1 or more ability score points. Lost points return at a rate of 1 per day unless noted otherwise by the condition dealing the damage. A character with Strength 0 falls to the ground and is <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#helpless">helpless</a>. A character with Dexterity 0 is <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#paralyzed">paralyzed</a>. A character with Constitution 0 is <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#dead">dead</a>. A character with Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 0 is <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#unconscious">unconscious</a>. <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#abilityDamage">Ability damage</a> is different from penalties to ability scores, which go away when the conditions causing them go away.
</p>

<h2 id="abilityDrained">Ability Drained</h2>
<p>
	The character has permanently lost 1 or more ability score points. The character can regain <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#abilityDrain">drained</a> points only through magical means. A character with Strength 0 falls to the ground and is <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#helpless">helpless</a>. A character with Dexterity 0 is <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#paralyzed">paralyzed</a>. A character with Constitution 0 is <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#dead">dead</a>. A character with Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 0 is <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#unconscious">unconscious</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="blinded">Blinded</h2>
<p>
	The character cannot see. He takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class, loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any), moves at half speed, and takes a -4 penalty on <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/search.htm">Search</a> checks and on most Strength- and Dexterity-based <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#skillChecks">skill checks</a>. All checks and activities that rely on vision (such as reading and <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/spot.htm">Spot</a> checks) automatically fail. All opponents are considered to have <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatModifiers.htm#totalConcealment">total concealment</a> (50% miss chance) to the blinded character. Characters who remain blinded for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.
</p>

<h2 id="blownAway">Blown Away</h2>
<p>
	Depending on its size, a creature can be blown away by winds of high velocity. A creature on the ground that is blown away is <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#knockedDown">knocked down</a> and rolls 1d4 Ã— 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/injuryandDeath.htm#nonlethalDamage">nonlethal damage</a> per 10 feet. A flying creature that is blown away is blown back 2d6 Ã— 10 feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffering.
</p>

<h2 id="checked">Checked</h2>
<p>
	Prevented from achieving forward motion by an applied force, such as wind. Checked creatures on the ground merely stop. Checked flying creatures move back a distance specified in the description of the effect.
</p>

<h2 id="confused"><em>Confused</em></h2>
<p>
	A confused characterâ€™s actions are determined by rolling <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="diceRoller" onclick="rollValue(&#39;Percentage&#39;,&#39;1d100&#39;);" title="Roll the dice!">d%</a> at the beginning of his turn: 01-10, attack caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster if attacking is not possible); 11-20, act normally; 21-50, do nothing but babble incoherently; 51-70, flee away from caster at top possible speed; 71-100, attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/sorcererWizard.htm#familiars">familiar</a> counts as part of the subjectâ€™s self). A confused character who canâ€™t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused character. Any confused character who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn comes. A confused character does not make <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/attacksOfOpportunity.htm">attacks of opportunity</a> against any creature that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked).
</p>

<h2 id="cowering">Cowering</h2>
<p>
	The character is frozen in <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#fear">fear</a> and can take no actions. A cowering character takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class and loses her Dexterity bonus (if any).
</p>

<h2 id="dazed">Dazed</h2>
<p>
	The creature is unable to act normally. A dazed creature can take no actions, but has no penalty to AC.
</p>
<p>
	A dazed condition typically lasts 1 round.
</p>

<h2 id="dazzled">Dazzled</h2>
<p>
	The creature is unable to see well because of overstimulation of the eyes. A dazzled creature takes a -1 penalty on <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#attackRoll">attack rolls</a>, <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/search.htm">Search</a> checks, and <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/spot.htm">Spot</a> checks.
</p>

<h2 id="dead">Dead</h2>
<p>
	The characterâ€™s hit points are reduced to -10, his Constitution drops to 0, or he is killed outright by a spell or effect. The characterâ€™s soul leaves his body. Dead characters cannot benefit from normal or magical healing, but they can be restored to life via magic. A dead body decays normally unless magically preserved, but magic that restores a dead character to life also restores the body either to full health or to its condition at the time of death (depending on the spell or device). Either way, resurrected characters need not worry about rigor mortis, decomposition, and other conditions that affect dead bodies.
</p>

<h2 id="deafened">Deafened</h2>
<p>
	A deafened character cannot hear. She takes a -4 penalty on initiative checks, automatically fails <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/listen.htm">Listen</a> checks, and has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components. Characters who remain deafened for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.
</p>

<h2 id="disabled">Disabled</h2>
<p>
	A character with 0 hit points, or one who has negative hit points but has become <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#stable">stable</a> and conscious, is disabled. A disabled character may take a single <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#moveActions">move action</a> or <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#standardActions">standard action</a> each round (but not both, nor can she take <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#fullRoundActions">full-round actions</a>). She moves at half speed. Taking move actions doesnâ€™t risk further injury, but performing any standard action (or any other action the game master deems strenuous, including some <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#freeActions">free actions</a> such as casting a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#quickenSpell">quickened</a> spell) deals 1 point of damage after the completion of the act. Unless the action increased the disabled characterâ€™s hit points, she is now in negative hit points and <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#dying">dying</a>.
</p>
<p>
	A disabled character with negative hit points recovers hit points naturally if she is being helped. Otherwise, each day she has a 10% chance to start recovering hit points naturally (starting with that day); otherwise, she loses 1 hit point. Once an unaided character starts recovering hit points naturally, she is no longer in danger of losing hit points (even if her current hit points are negative).
</p>

<h2 id="dying">Dying</h2>
<p>
	A dying character is <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#unconscious">unconscious</a> and near death. She has -1 to -9 current hit points. A dying character can take no actions and is unconscious. At the end of each round (starting with the round in which the character dropped below 0 hit points), the character rolls <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="diceRoller" onclick="rollValue(&#39;Percentage&#39;,&#39;1d100&#39;);" title="Roll the dice!">d%</a> to see whether she becomes <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#stable">stable</a>. She has a 10% chance to become stable. If she does not, she loses 1 hit point. If a dying character reaches -10 hit points, she is <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#dead">dead</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="energyDrained">Energy Drained</h2>
<p>
	The character gains one or more negative levels, which might permanently drain the characterâ€™s levels. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as Hit Dice, he dies. Each negative level gives a creature the following penalties: -1 penalty on <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#attackRoll">attack rolls</a>, <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#savingThrows">saving throws</a>, <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#skillChecks">skill checks</a>, <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#abilityChecks">ability checks</a>; loss of 5 hit points; and -1 to effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities). In addition, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from the highest spell level castable.
</p>

<h2 id="entangled">Entangled</h2>
<p>
	The character is ensnared. Being entangled impedes movement, but does not entirely prevent it unless the bonds are anchored to an immobile object or tethered by an opposing force. An entangled creature moves at half speed, cannot <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#run">run</a> or <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/specialAttacks.htm#charge">charge</a>, and takes a -2 penalty on all <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#attackRoll">attack rolls</a> and a -4 penalty to Dexterity. An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/concentration.htm">Concentration</a> check (DC 15 + the spellâ€™s level) or lose the spell.
</p>

<h2 id="exhausted">Exhausted</h2>
<p>
	An exhausted character moves at half speed and takes a -6 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. After 1 hour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#fatigued">fatigued</a>. A fatigued character becomes exhausted by doing something else that would normally cause fatigue.
</p>

<h2 id="fascinated">Fascinated</h2>
<p>
	A fascinated creature is entranced by a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities">supernatural</a> or spell effect. The creature stands or sits quietly, taking no actions other than to pay attention to the fascinating effect, for as long as the effect lasts. It takes a -4 penalty on <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#skillChecks">skill checks</a> made as reactions, such as <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/listen.htm">Listen</a> and <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/spot.htm">Spot</a> checks. Any potential threat, such as a hostile creature approaching, allows the fascinated creature a new <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#savingThrows">saving throw</a> against the fascinating effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the fascinated creature, automatically breaks the effect. A fascinated creatureâ€™s ally may shake it free of the spell as a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#standardActions">standard action</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="fatigued">Fatigued</h2>
<p>
	A fatigued character can neither <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#run">run</a> nor <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/specialAttacks.htm#charge">charge</a> and takes a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. Doing anything that would normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued character to become <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#exhausted">exhausted</a>. After 8 hours of complete rest, fatigued characters are no longer fatigued.
</p>

<h2 id="flatFooted">Flat-Footed</h2>
<p>
	A character who has not yet acted during a combat is <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#flatFooted">flat-footed</a>, not yet reacting normally to the situation. A <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#flatFooted">flat-footed</a> character loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) and cannot make <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/attacksOfOpportunity.htm">attacks of opportunity</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="frightened">Frightened</h2>
<p>
	A frightened creature flees from the source of its <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#fear">fear</a> as best it can. If unable to flee, it may fight.

A frightened creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.
</p>
<p>
	Frightened is like <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#shaken">shaken</a>, except that the creature must flee if possible. <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#panicked">Panicked</a> is a more extreme state of <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#fear">fear</a>.

<h2 id="grappling">Grappling</h2>

He does not threaten any squares, and loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) against opponents he isnâ€™t grappling. See <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/specialAttacks.htm#grapple">Grapple</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="helpless">Helpless</h2>

A helpless target is treated as having a Dexterity of 0 (-5 modifier). Melee attacks against a helpless target get a +4 bonus (equivalent to attacking a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#prone">prone</a> target).
