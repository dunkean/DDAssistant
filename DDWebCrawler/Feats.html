        <h1>Aberration Wild Shape</h1>

        <p>Most druids detest aberrations and think of them as outside nature, but some view them simply as examples of nature from an extreme and alien world. Thanks to your heritage, you are one of these latter, and have learned to channel your inhuman bloodline into your shapeshifting power.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Aberration Blood, wild shape ability.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can use your wild shape ability to assume the form of an aberration. This otherwise functions identically to your normal wild shape ability. The size of the aberration is limited by the size of animal you can normally assume the shape of with wild shape.

        <p>Although you are not a recognized member of one of the dragonmarked families, you have manifested a dragonmark. 
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Dragonmarked race (human, dwarf, elf, gnome, halfling, half-elf, or half-orc). 
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This feat provides you with a single dragonmark spell-like ability that is not directly tied to the trueborn dragonmarked houses. All aberrant mark spell-like abilities can be used once per day. When you select this feat, you must choose an aberrant dragonmark spell-like ability from the following list. You can never improve this mark in any way, and you can never gain a second mark. A character with one of the true dragonmarks (least, lesser, or greater)cannot select this feat, and a character with this feat cannot later select one of the true dragonmark feats. A saving throw against your aberrant dragonmark spell-like ability has a DC of 10 + spell level + your Cha modifier. (Spell level for an aberrant dragonmark ability is always 1st.) Your caster level for your aberrant dragonmark spell-like ability is one-half your character level. <br>Aberrant Mark Powers:burning hands, cause fear, charm person, chill touch, detect secret doors, feather fall, inflict light wounds, jump, light, pass without trace, produce flame, shield, Tenser&apos;s floating disk. <br>Aberrant dragonmarks are mutations that appear occasionally among the dragonmarked races (usually to those not of a dragonmarked house)that can be traced back to the bloodlines of corrupted dragonmarked families eliminated in the War of the Mark. At a quick glance, an aberrant mark could be mistaken for an established dragonmark, but on close inspection its differences are readily apparent.

        <p>You can cast spells that do additional damage to aberrations.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you cast a spell that deals damage to an aberration, you deal an extra 2d6 points of damage.<br>A single spell can never gain this extra damage more than once per casting. For instance, a fireball deals the extra damage to all aberrations in the area it affects. However, if a 3rd-level wizard casts magic missile and produces two missiles, only one of them (of the wizard&apos;s choice) gains the extra damage, whether or not both missiles are directed at the same aberration or two different aberrations. If a spell deals damage for more than 1 round, it deals this extra damage in each round.<br>Scrolls scribed by you do not gain any benefit from Aberration Banemagic. Scrolls activated by you also gain no benefit from Aberration Banemagic. The same is true for most other magic items, such as wands and potions. However, staffs activated by you use not only your caster level but also gain the benefit of this feat, if applicable.<br>If the spell allows a saving throw, the DC of the saving throw increases by 2. The additional damage dealt by this spell is either halved on a successful saving throw or negated entirely, depending on how the regular damage dealt by the spell is affected by a successful saving throw.

You can elect to postpone your selections until you gain another level. If you have postponed a selection from an earlier level, you can trade in four Menu A selections for one selection from the Menu C.

            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Table 1-1: Advanced Construction Special Abilities</p><ul><li><strong>Menu A</strong><br><strong>Brawn (Ex)</strong>: Construct does an additional +1 point of damage on a successful melee attack. (Multiple selections stack, and you cannot select this ability more than 8 times.)<br><strong>Claws (Ex)</strong>: The construct has razor sharp claws. Attacks are now considered claw attacks instead of slams. Damage from these claw attacks is 1d8 + Strength modifier. The claw attacks are considered slashing or piercing weapons. The type is chosen when the construct is manifested. (If the construct has the extra arms ability, this ability must be chosen twice to affect both sets of arms.)<br><strong>Cleave (Ex)</strong>: The cleave extraordinary ability works as the Cleave feat, and though no prerequisites are required (Str 13+, Power Attack), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either. <br><strong>Dodge (Ex)</strong>: The dodge extraordinary ability works as the Dodge feat, and though no prerequisites are required (Dex 13+), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either.<br>Improved Bull Rush (Ex): The improved bull rush extraordinary ability works as the Improved Bull Rush feat, and though no prerequisites are required (Str 13+, Power Attack), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either.<br>Power Attack (Ex): The power attack extraordinary ability works as the Power Attack feat, and though no prerequisites are required (Str 13+), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either.<br>Spiked Armor (Ex): The construct&apos;s body is covered in spikes. The spikes allow the construct to deal 1d6 points of piercing damage (x2 critical) with a successful trample, squeeze, bull rush, or grapple attack.</li><li><strong>Menu B</strong><br>Astral Repair (Ex): The astral construct heals 2 hit points each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point.<br>Carapace (Ex): The construct&apos;s surface forms hard, armorlike plates. The construct gains a damage reduction of 10/+1. This replaces any damage reduction the construct might already have.<br>Energy Touch (Ex): The construct&apos;s physical attacks do 1d4 points of energy damage (fire, cold, electricity, sonic, acid) in addition to their standard damage. The type of energy is chosen when the construct is manifested. (Multiple selections stack and may be of different energy types. You cannot select this ability more than 5 times.)<br>Extra Arms (Ex): The construct has an additional set of arms and can make an additional attack with an attack bonus equal to its highest attack bonus -2. (A construct with squeeze or rend can use that ability with these arms, as well.) This ability cannot be chosen more than once.)<br>Expertise (Ex): The expertise extraordinary ability works as the Expertise feat, and though no prerequisites are required (Int 13+), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either.<br>Great Cleave (Ex): The great cleave extraordinary ability works as the Great Cleave feat, and though no prerequisites are required (Str +13, Power Attack, Cleave, base attack bonus +4 or higher), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either.<br>Improved Critical (Ex): The improved critical extraordinary ability works as the Improved Critical feat, and though no prerequisites are required (proficient with weapon, base attack bonus +8 or higher), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either.<br>Improved Fly (Ex): Construct has physical wings (12-foot wingspan) and a speed of 120 feet (average). (This is similar to the power in the Psionics Handbook, though slower.)<br>Improved Swim (Ex): Construct becomes streamlined and shark-like with a large (8-foot-wide) tail. Its speed is 120 feet.<br>Mobility (Ex): The mobility extraordinary ability works as the Mobility feat, and though no prerequisites are required (Dex 13+, Dodge), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either.<br>Poison Touch (Ex): The construct is covered in a shimmering purple liquid. If the construct hits with a melee attack, the target must make an initial Fortitude save (DC 15) or take 1d2 points of temporary Wisdom damage. A minute later, the target must save again (Fortitude save DC 15) or lose 1d4 points of temporary Wisdom damage.<br>Reach (Ex): The construct&apos;s arms elongate, which increases its reach by 5 feet. (If the construct has the extra arms ability, this ability must be chosen twice to affect both sets of arms.)<br>Spike Volley (Ex): The construct can send forth a volley of 3 spikes as a standard action. This ranged attack has a range of 120 feet with no range increment. These spike attacks are treated as thrown weapons, so the construct&apos;s Strength bonus is applied to damage (see <a href="../../stores/weapons.shtml">Weapons</a> for more on thrown weapons). Damage is 1d6 + Strength modifier per spike. The construct can use this attack up to three times. (The construct must have the spiked armor ability to use this attack.) This volley can be fired in any direction (including straight up) regardless of the direction the construct is facing.<br>Stunning Fist (Ex): The stunning fist extraordinary ability works as the Stunning Fist feat, and though no prerequisites are required (Dex 13+, Improved Unarmed Strike, Wis 13+, base attack bonus +8 or higher), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either.<br>Tough (Ex): The construct receives 7 hit points per die, instead of 5.5 per die.</li><li><strong>Menu C</strong><br>Ectoplasmic Form (Sp): The construct manifests ectoplasmic form as a standard action.<br>Hardened Carapace (Ex): The construct&apos;s surface forms hard, armorlike plates. The construct gains a damage reduction of 15/+2. This replaces any damage reduction the construct might already have.<br>Power Resistance (Ex): The construct gains a power resistance of 5 + the construct&apos;s Hit Dice. This ability can be chosen multiple times and adds 5 to the power resistance of the construct. For example, choosing this ability three times for an astral construct IX would give a total power resistance of 34 (19 + 5 + 5 +5 = 34)<br>Rend (Ex): A construct that hits with its claw attack does an additional 2d6 + 1.5 times its Strength modifier points of damage. (It must also have the claws ability; see entry above. A construct cannot use squeeze and rend in the same round.)<br>Spike Flurry (Ex): The construct can send forth a hail of spikes as a standard action. The attack is a cone shape with a range of 60 feet. Anyone caught in the flurry is immediately struck by 2d4 spikes that deal 1d6 damage each. A successful Reflex save (DC 13) halves the damage. This attack can be used only once. (The construct must have the spiked armor ability to use this attack.)<br>Spring Attack (Ex): The spring attack extraordinary ability works as the Spring Attack feat, and though no prerequisites are required, constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either.<br>Tail Slap (Ex): The construct has a tail and gains one additional slam attack with an attack bonus equal to its highest attack bonus -2, and it deals damage of 2d8 + 1.5 times its Strength modifier (A construct cannot have a tail if it has extra arms.)<br>Tougher (Ex): The construct receives 8.5 hit points per die, instead of 5.5 per die.<br>Whirlwind Attack (Ex): The whirlwind attack extraordinary ability works as the Whirlwind Attack feat, and though no prerequisites are required (Int 13+, Expertise, Dex 13+, Dodge, Mobility, base attack bonus +4 or higher, Spring Attack), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either.</li><li><strong>Menu D</strong><br>Amplified Invisibility (Sp): The construct manifests amplified invisibility (self only) as a standard action.<br>Extra Hard Carapace (Ex): The construct&apos;s surface forms hard, armorlike plates. The construct gains a damage reduction of 20/+3. This replaces any damage reduction the construct might already have.<br>Mass Concussion (Sp): The construct manifests mass concussion as a free action 3 times per day.<br>Super Buff (Ex): The construct gains 17d10 temporary hit points. Multiple selections do not stack.<br>Toughest (Ex): The construct receives 10 hit points per die, instead of 5.5 per die.<br>Ultraheavy Armor (Ex): The construct gains a +10 deflection bonus to AC.<br>Whitefire Aura (Ex): The entire surface of the construct radiates with an intense white-hot flame. Creatures within 5 feet of the construct take 5d4 points of damage. The fire ignites combustibles as the whitefire power. Once activated, the aura burns for a number of rounds equal to half of the construct&apos;s Hit Dice. Multiple selections do not stack.</li></ul><p>

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This feat can be used to enhance any spell or power with the acid descriptor. In addition to dealing its normal damage, an effect enhanced by Agitated Causticity literally softens up its target. This effect does not represent damage to armor, shields, or body parts that provide a natural armor bonus; it is a function of the acid&apos;s effect on the target creature itself.<br>For each 5 points of acid damage the target takes from such a spell or power, it must make a successful Fortitude save or take a -1 cumulative penalty to its Armor Class. The DC for this save equals the save DC for the spell or power (or the save DC it would otherwise have if no save is allowed). All other modifiers to AC apply normally.<br>The penalty from this effect decreases naturally at the rate of 1 point per day. Any effect that heals ability damage may also be used to reduce or eliminate the penalty by the same amount.<br>To apply Agitated Causticity to a spell, the caster must expend 3 power points per spell level. To apply it to a psionic power, the manifester must spend 1 spell level per power level.

            <br><strong>Sources:</strong>  Dragon #311<br> Dragon Compendium Vol. 1<br></p>
        <p>One of your ancestors was a creature of elemental air. Beings associated with this element come in almost endless variety, and your characteristics might vary with the type of elemental creature from which you are descended. Regardless of your exact ancestry, you are likely to have blue eyes and wild, unkempt hair.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: <br>The descendants of cloud giants tend to be tall, loud, and often arrogant, but they have a strong appreciation for beauty. Characters with storm giant ancestors, on the other hand, tend toward gentleness and tolerance, but they can display violent tempers when provoked. Descendants of elemental flying creatures display a predatory nature in their movements and behavior, always preferring to keep the advantage of height and distance when dealing with others. Dust mephits produce skinny, morbid descendants, air mephits pass along their lively nature, and ice mephits lend their aloof and distant manner to their posterity.<br>Restless and moody, sorcerers with the Air Bloodline feat often adventure just to move. They might seem apathetic at times, but they can surprise others with quick emotional displays. Such characters tend to be impatient when others want to be still, and they enjoy spending long periods of time in debate.
            <br><strong>Clan</strong>: Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your ancestry gives you a bonus spell known at each spell level, starting at 1st, according to the following list.</p><ul><li>1. Obscuring mist</li><li>2. Gust of wind</li><li>3. Wind wall</li><li>4. Shout</li><li>5. Telekinesis</li><li>6. Control winds</li><li>7. Ethereal jaunt</li><li>8. Summon monster VIII (elementals and outsiders with the air subtype only)</li><li>9. Freedom</li></ul><p>
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If a character takes this feat any time after 1st level and has already learned any of the spells on this list in the class that granted him access to this feat, he gains no additional spells known at those spell levels. This restriction does not apply if he learned any of these spells as a member of another spellcasting class.<br>Characters with Air Bloodline cannot learn or cast spells with the earth descriptor, and all such spells are removed from the spell lists of all their spellcasting classes.

        <p>You own an ancestral heirloom and can invest it with increasing power.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any good alignment, character level 3rd.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose an item you own. The item must be of masterwork quality, and it must be an item that once belonged to a member of your family. Alternatively, the item may have belonged to another person to whom you are somehow connected, such as another member of your religious order.<br>At any time, you may retreat to a consecrated or hallowed location and spend time in prayer in order to awaken the spirits in your ancestral relic. This requires a sacrifice of valuable items worth the difference between the market price of the magic item your relic will become and the market price of your current relic. This sacrifice does not have to be gold - you can sacrifice magic items or other goods worth the required amount, rather than selling your goods (at half value) to pay for the sacrifice. You must spend 1 day per 1,000 gp value you sacrifice. During this rime, you must spend at least 5 hours each day in prayer or meditation, not stopping to eat or rest.<br>For example, a 4th-level paladin has a masterwork bastard sword she inherited from her grandfather. She makes sacrifices worth 2,000 gp and spends two days in prayer and fasting in the temple of Heironeous. When she emerges, her devotion has awakened the magic inherent in the blade, making it a <em>+1 bastard sword</em>. When she reaches 7th level, she once again retreats to the temple for 6 days, sacrificing items worth an additional 6,000 gp to make her weapon a <em>+2 bastard sword</em> (market price 8,000 gp). When she reaches 11th level, she can make it a <em>+2 holy bastard sword</em> by making sacrifices worth 24,000 gp (the difference between 32,000 and 8,000 gp) and spending 24 days in prayer.<br>A character&apos;s level dictates the maximum value of his or her ancestral relic, as shown below.<br>No character may have more than one ancestral relic. </p><table class="table" style="width:30em"><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Ancestral Relic</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Character level</strong></td><td><strong>Maximum Relic Value</strong></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>1,350gp</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>2,700 gp</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>4,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>6,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>9,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>13,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>18,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>24,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>33,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>44,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>55,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>75,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>100,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>130,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>170,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>220,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>290,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>380,000 gp</td></tr></table><p>

        <p>Your ancestry contains an aquatic fey creature. The characteristics you display might depend in part on the kind of aquatic fey heritage you have.<br>Characters with aquatic fey bloodlines vary in appearance, but are almost always strikingly beautiful. Those descended from water nymphs typically have pointed ears, and non-elves often confuse them with elves. Descendants of sirines tend to be wistful, and - like their fey parent - often have a slight yellow or green tinge to their skin and silvery or light-green hair. Fossergrim-blooded characters are usually male, have light hair and striking blue eyes, and exude a rugged masculinity. Those descended from kelpies vary in appearance greatly but almost universally possess evil hearts filled with darkness. While not exactly fey, many believe selkies descended from fey creatures. Characters with selkie blood typically have light gray, blond, or deep red hair, and often have slightly webbed hands and feet.<br>Sorcerers with aquatic fey blood have a natural aptitude for casting enchantment spells (particularly those of the charm and mind-affecting descriptors), transmutation spells (as many aquatic fey are known for their ability to shapechange), and water spells.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation, ability to summon a familiar.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your ancestry gives you a bonus spell known at each spell level, starting at 1st, from the following list.</p><ul><li>1st - Charm person</li><li>2nd - Alter self</li><li>3rd - Water breathing</li><li>4th - Charm monster</li><li>5th - Mindfog</li><li>6th - Control water</li><li>7th - Control weather</li><li>8th - Horrid wilting</li><li>9th - Shapechange</li></ul><p>
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If a character takes this feat anytime after 1st level and has already learned any of the spells on this list in the class to which she applies this feat, she gains no additional spells known at those spell levels. This restriction does not apply if she learned any of these spells as a member of another spell-casting class.<br>Characters with this feat cannot learn or cast spells from the conjuration (creation) or conjuration (healing) subschools, and all such spells are removed from the spell lists of all their spellcasting classes.

If your weapon&apos;s range increment is different underwater than it is above the water, count the water surface as the beginning of a new range increment, and use your underwater range increment after the point at which your weapon strikes the water.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Thrown weapons are not usable underwater. Ranged attacks through water normally receive a penalty of -2 for every 5 feet of water they pass through. An aquatic longbow has a range increment of 10 feet underwater. A target in water has improved cover or total cover against attacks from out of the water.

        <p>You know how to cast spells that work equally well in or out of water.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Water does not impede your spells. Creatures partially or completely submerged do not gain cover or total cover when you cast a spell from outside the water. The surface does not block line of effect for any spell, including spells with the fire descriptor. You need not make a Spellcraft check to cast a fire spell underwater.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Partially or completely submerged creatures gain improved or total cover against attacks from land. The water surface blocks line of effect for fire spells. Fire spells do not function underwater unless the caster succeeds on a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level).

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Perform 4 ranks, Arcane Flourish, arcane caster level 1st, bardic music.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a swift action, you can expend a prepared spell or a spell slot to extend the duration of your bardic music ability after you stop performing. You extend the duration a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell used in this manner. This extension is in addition to the normal duration of the effect after you stop your performance.<br>You can expend only one spell slot to extend the duration of your bardic music. The slot can come from any of your arcane caster classes, not just bard.<br>This has no effect on bardic music or similar abilities with a duration of instantaneous or permanent.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Arcane Toughness, Toughness, arcane caster level 6th.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per day as a swift action, you can grant the next spell you cast a +4 bonus on its save DC.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Add the chosen domain&apos;s spells to your class list of arcane spells. If you have arcane spellcasting ability from more than one class, you must pick which arcane spellcasting ability this feat applies to. Once chosen, this decision cannot be changed for that feat.<br>You may learn these spells as normal for your class; however, you use Wisdom (rather than the normal ability for your spellcasting) when determining the save DC for the spell. In addition, you must have a Wisdom score equal to 10 + the spell&apos;s level in order to prepare or cast a spell gained from this feat.<br>Each day, you may prepare (or cast, if you cast spells without preparation) a maximum of one of these domains spells of each level.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can take this feat more than once.

For example, a character who chose Heironeous and the Good domain with his first selection could choose Law or War with successive selections of the same feat.

        <p>You can craft a unique signature staff or other item that serves as a focus for your magic.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Craft Wondrous Item, any metamagic feat, arcane caster level 3rd.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You create a personal arcane device that you carry with you, typically a staff but optionally another item like a pocket watch or amulet. This device serves as a focus for magical energy, improving your ability to apply metamagic effects to spells. You must hold the item in your hand in order to gain its benefits. If you spontaneously cast spells (as a sorcerer does), three times per day the focus allows you to apply a metamagic feat to a spell without increasing its casting time. If you prepare spells (as a wizard does), three times per day you may spontaneously convert any spell into a metamagic-enhanced version of any lower-level spell you currently have prepared. Converting a spell in this way forces you to lose the higher level spell, which must be of the appropriate spell level for the spell you cast and the metamagic feat you use. You must have the metamagic feat you wish to use in this way. For example, you may spontaneously lose a prepared fireball spell in order to cast an empowered magic missile, but only if you have both a normal fireball and a normal magic missile spell prepared. In addition, you may treat the item as an arcane focus in place of any spell components worth 1 gp or less, and a hand in which you hold the device is considered your free hand for the purpose of casting somatic components. You may also use magic item creation feats such as Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Staff, and Craft Wondrous Item to enhance the device as an item of its type. If you lose your arcane device or it is not on you, all your spells suffer a -1 penalty to caster level until you recover it or create a new one. If you have your device on you but aren&apos;t wearing or wielding it actively, you suffer no ill effects but neither do you gain any benefits.<br>Creating an arcane device costs 100 gp and takes 24 hours.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A wizard may take Arcane Focus Item as a wizard bonus feat.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast 1st-level arcane spells.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As long as you have at least one arcane spell slot available (either a prepared arcane spell or the ability to cast an arcane spell spontaneously), you may make a DC 20 Concentration check to gain arcane focus. This use of Concentration requires a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Once you acquire arcane focus, you remain focused until you expend it, become unconscious, fall asleep, or cast all available arcane spells.<br>When you have arcane focus, you may expend your focus as a swift action on any single Concentration check you make thereafter. If you expend your focus for this purpose, treat your Concentration check as if you rolled a 15 (similar to taking 10). You may expend your arcane focus in this way even if you could not normally take 10 on a skill check, such as during combat. You may instead expend your arcane focus to activate an arcane feat you possess and gain one of the benefits of that feat.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A wizard may select Arcane Focus as a wizard bonus feat.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Wizard level 1st.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you prepare spells, you can break down up to three existing arcane spell slots to create a specified number of lower-level spell slots. (A 0-level spell counts as 1/2 level for this purpose, so a 1st-level spell slot could be broken into two 0-level spell slots.) The sum of the levels of all the new spell slots must equal the level of the original. The number of spell slots you can create in this manner is otherwise unlimited. Spell slots that you break down into multiple lower-level slots remain that way until the next time you prepare spells, at which time you can choose to restore your spell slots to normal or break them up again.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A character can always choose to use a higher-level spell slot to prepare a lower-level spell, but any &quot;remainder&quot; spell levels are lost.

        <p>You can prepare an arcane spell ahead of time, just as a wizard does.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Each day, you can use one or more of your spell slots to prepare spells you know, usually for the purpose of applying a metamagic feat to the spell-but without an increase in its casting time. Preparing a spell uses a spell slot of the appropriate level, and once prepared, that slot can&apos;t be used for anything else until the prepared spell is cast.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Spellcasters who cast arcane spells without preparation (such as sorcerers and bards) who apply a metamagic feat to a spell must cast it as a full-round action instead of a standard action.

        <p>In your homeland, all who show some skill at the Art may receive training as arcane spellcasters. Thus, many characters know something of the ways of the bard, the sorcerer, or the wizard.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Deep Imaskari (Underdark [Deep Imaskar]), human (Chessenta, the Golden Water, Halruaa, Lantan, Mulhorand, Nimbral, Unther, or the Wizards&apos; Reach), or planetouched (Chessenta).
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one arcane spellcasting class (bard, sorcerer, or wizard). You can activate spell trigger magic items as if you had 1 level in the selected class. The selected class also becomes a favored class for you in addition to any other favored class you have or select. For example, a multiclass human fighter/rogue who selects wizard for this feat could add levels of wizard without taking any experience penalty for multiclassing in three classes.

        <p>You discovered a shorthand method for recording spells in spellbooks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You scribe spells in a spellbook using a shorthand that lets you transcribe faster and to occupy less space than normal. This shorthand cuts in half the time required to write a spell in a spellbook. Such spells also take up half as many pages and require half as much of the special materials normally used. 
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: The Spellcraft DC to learn or prepare a spell from a borrowed spellbook written in shorthand equals 25 + spell level.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: A spellbook written with this method holds more spells and is thus worth more than a normal spellbook of the same number of pages. A wizard may take Arcane Shorthand as a wizard bonus feat.

        <p>You can channel arcane energy into your melee attacks.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast 3rd-level arcane spells, base attack bonus +4.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you activate this feat (a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity), you can channel arcane energy into a melee weapon, your unarmed strike, or natural weapons. You must sacrifice one of your spells for the day (of 1st level or higher) to do this, but you gain a bonus on all your attack tolls for 1 round equal to the level of the spell sacrificed, as well as extra damage equal to 1d4 points x the level of the spell sacrificed. The bonus you add to your attack rolls from this feat cannot be greater than your base attack bonus.<br>For example, Yarren the bladesinger has a base attack bonus of +11 and the ability to cast 4th-level arcane spells. On his turn, he chooses to sacrifice one of his 4th-level spells for the day, marking it off as if he had cast it. Until his next turn, Yarren gains an extra +4 bonus on his attack rolls and an extra 4d4 points of damage with a single melee weapon of his choice (his rapier).

        <p>You have studied a single spell in-depth. Your expertise grants you formidable though narrowly focused arcane mastery.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Knowledge (arcana) 9 ranks, ability to cast arcane spells.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one arcane spell that you can cast to be your thesis spell. When casting that spell, you do so at +2 caster level. When you apply a metamagic feat other than Heighten Spell to that spell, the enhanced spell uses up a spell slot one level lower than normal. For example, an empowered thesis spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&apos;s actual slot (rather than the normal two levels higher).
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new spell.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Toughness, arcane caster level 3rd.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can expend a prepared spell or spell slot as an immediate action when you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. You heal a number of points of damage equal to the level of the spell or spell slot used in this manner. You cannot use this ability to negate effects that disable you without causing hit point damage, such as a medusa&apos;s ability to turn you to stone. Even if this healing does not bring you above negative hit points, it still stabilizes you.<br>Using a 0-level spell with this feat grants no benefit.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Item Reprieve, Spell Reprieve, specialist wizard level 10th.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose a school of magic that was previously prohibited to you because of your arcane specialization. You can now learn and cast spells from that school normally, as if you were not a specialist wizard.

For example, a 4th-level monk/2nd-level ninja with this feat could use her <em>ki</em> powers a number of times equal to 3 (half the sum of her monk and ninja levels) + her Wisdom bonus (if any).<br>Your monk and ninja levels also stack for the purpose of determining your unarmed strike damage, as well as your <em>ki</em> strike class feature. For example, a 4th-level monk/6rh-level ninja would deal 1d10 points of damage with her unarmed strike, and her unarmed strike would overcome damage reduction as a lawful magic weapon (as if she were a 10th-level monk).<br>In addition, you can multiclass freely between the monk and ninja classes. You must still remain lawful in order to continue advancing as a monk. You still face the normal XP penalties for having multiple classes more than one level apart.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A monk can select Ascetic Stalker as a bonus feat at 1st, 2nd, or 6th level instead of one of the other feats indicated for those levels.

        <p>You have been trained in the druidic traditions of the Ashbound, seeing yourself as one of nature&apos;s avengers. You consider the use of arcane magic to be a vile and unnatural act. 
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to spontaneously cast <em>summon nature&apos;s ally</em>. 
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The duration of your <em>summon nature&apos;s ally</em> spells is doubled. Creatures summoned by those spells receive a +3 luck bonus on their attack rolls.

        <p>You are beloved by the people, and the commonfolk seek out your leadership.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Leadership, character level 6th, leadership score 4 higher than your level.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain a permanent +1 bonus to your Leadership score. You gain a number of additional 1st-level followers equal to the number of higher-level followers you are allowed. These additional 1st-level followers do not replace your higher-Level followers. For example, a paladin with a leadership score of 18 normally can attract thirty-five 1st-level followers, three 2nd-level followers, and one follower each of 3rd and 4th Levels. With this feat, she can have up to forty 1st-level followers (thirty-five plus the number of 2nd, 3rd, and 4th-level followers), three 2nd-level followers, and one follower each of 3rd and 4th levels.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: You typically may only recruit followers up to the limit allowed by your Leadership score.

        <p>You learn to use a supernatural ability of an assumed form.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Wis 13, ability to assume a new form magically.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You learn to use a single supernatural ability of another kind of creature while assuming its form through a <em>polymorph self</em> spell or a similar effect. The saving throw DC against this ability is based on your ability scores, not those of a standard creature of the kind whose form you have assumed. For a breath weapon, the saving throw DC is 10 + your Constitution modifier + 1/2 your Hit Dice (rounded down). For all other supernatural abilities, the saving throw (if any) DC is 10 + your Charisma modifier + 1/2 your Hit Dice (rounded down).<br>If a creature, such as an undead, has no Constitution score, use its Charisma modifier or its Constitution modifier (+0 for a non-ability), whichever is higher, to determine the save DC.<br>Using this alien ability is disorienting. You take a penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. Additionally, in a stressful or demanding situation (such as combat), you must succeed on a Will save (DC 19) or be unable to use the ability.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can take this feat multiple times. You cannot apply it more than once to the same special ability in order to improve the Will save DC. Each time you take this feat, it applies to a different special ability.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Without this feat, you cannot use the supernatural abilities of a creature whose form you assume.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can use your astral cord as a whip with an enhancement bonus equal to +1 per four character levels (maximum +5). The cord functions exactly like a whip, except that it deals normal rather than subdual damage. You are considered proficient with the weapon when using your astral cord as a whip.

        <p>You have learned to take volatile astral ectoplasm and ignite it with elemental fire to create intense, lingering fire effects.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any two powers with the fire descriptor, any two spells with the fire descriptor.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This feat can be applied to any spell or power with the fire descriptor. Flaming ectoplasm is sticky, and it keeps burning when normal fire would sear and dissipate.<br>Anyone damaged by an effect enhanced by Astral Fire continues to take fire damage for a number of rounds equal to the ability modifier that applies to the spell or power used (minimum 1 round). This lingering damage equals 1 point per 5 points of fire damage that the original attack dealt (minimum 1 point unless the subject evades all fire damage from the effect or otherwise takes no damage from the initial effect).<br>Ectoplasmic fire is more difficult to douse than normal fire. It cannot be smothered, and water does not put it out - in fact, even submerging a burning creature in water has no effect on the fire. However, effects such as control flames function normally with respect to ectoplasmic fire. Also, since ectoplasm is stable and inert on the Astral Plane, shifting a burning target there immediately suppresses the effect. Any time that the victim spends on the Astral Plane counts against the duration of the effect, but the fire reignites immediately should the victim leave before it expires.<br>To apply Astral Fire to a spell, the caster must expend 3 power points per spell level. To apply it to a psionic power, the manifester must spend 1 spell level per power level.

        <p>You can follow tracks across the featureless wastes of the Astral Plane. In addition, you can try to determine the destination of a creature that has used a teleport spell or effect.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Knowledge (the planes) 11 ranks, Spellcraft 8 ranks, Survival 10 ranks, Track.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can attempt to track a creature normally, even through the featureless wastes of the Astral Plane (base Survival DC 25). In addition, when standing at the location (on any plane) from which a creature departed by means of a <em>teleportation</em> spell or effect, you can determine its destination with a successful Survival check (DC 30). If you have your own means of teleportation, you can then teleport to that location as though you had viewed it once.

        <p>You can magically imbue gems to hold a spell until triggered.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Intelligence 13+, Craft (gemcutting) skill, arcane spellcaster level 3rd+.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can store an arcane spell in a gem. You must have the spell available to cast (prepared if you must prepare spells; known otherwise) and must provide any material components or focuses the spell requires. If casting the spell would reduce your XP total, you pay the cost upon beginning the attunement in addition to the XP cost for making the attuned gem itself. Likewise, material components are consumed when you begin casting, but focuses are not. (A focus used in attuning a gem can be reused.) The caster level of the spell must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own caster level.<br>A gem can only be attuned with a single spell. The gem must have a minimum value equal to 50 gp per level of the spell to be stored. The base price of an attuned gem (not including the gem&apos;s inherent value) is equal to 50 gp per spell level times the caster level. You must spend 1/25 of the base price in XP and use up raw materials costing half this base price. Attunement requires 1 hour plus the spell&apos;s normal casting time. The magic gem&apos;s market price equals its base price plus its inherent value as a gem.<br>See the Gem Magic section in the of Magic of Faer&#xFB;n for the details of attuned gems and gem magic.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Str 25, Power Attack, improved Bull Rush, size Large or larger.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a standard action, the creature may choose to subtract 4 from its melee attack roll and deliver an awesome blow, if the creature hits a corporeal opponent smaller than itself with an awesome blow, its opponent must succeed on a Reflex save (DC = damage dealt) or be knocked flying to feet in a direction of the attacking creature&apos;s choice and fall prone. The attacking creature can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&apos;t move closer to the attacking creature than the square it started in.

        <p>Through a combination of sheer muscle and mystical acumen, you can deliver devastating smite attacks.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Power Attack, base attack bonus +6, smite ability.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This feat allows the use of three tactical maneuvers, each of which requires that you make a smite attack while using the Power Attack feat (minimum attack penalty -1). You must declare the use of this feat before making the attack roll. You can employ only one of these maneuvers at a time.<br><em>Demolishing Smite</em>: Your smite attack punches through your enemy&apos;s defenses. For the purpose of this single attack, you can ignore a number of points of damage reduction (except DR/- or DR/epic) up to twice your Charisma bonus (if any). For instance, if your Charisma is 17 (+3 bonus), you ignore 6 points of your target&apos;s damage reduction when making a demolishing smite.<br><em>Overwhelming Smite</em>: Your smite attack can knock an opponent prone. If the attack hits and deals damage, it is treated as though it were also a trip attack. Make a Strength check opposed by the defender&apos;s Strength or Dexterity, with all the normal trip modifiers. A foe that resists is not entitled to make a trip attempt against you in return. You can attempt an overwhelming smite only once per round.<br><em>Seeking Smite</em>: Your smite attack is uncannily guided to its target. For the purpose of this single attack, you ignore any miss chance your foe might have, though your weapon must still be able to strike the target. Thus, while this maneuver allows you to strike an incorporeal creature unerringly with a magic sword, it does not allow you to strike it with a nonmagical weapon.

        <p>You are descended from a native of a lawful plane. The most common members of this bloodline are the spawns of devils, who sow their seed in the Material Plane as part of far reaching and complex plots against their rivals. Archons create mixed-blood offspring with mortals in order to counter the machinations of devils and other evil outsiders. Rarely, mortal travelers who spend a significant portion of their lives in a lawfully aligned plane begin to take on some of the traits of that plane that later manifest in their descendants.<br>Members of this bloodline are almost exclusively lawful. They seem driven by an inner set of rules that generally work in accordance with the laws of the land. They tend to have a symmetrical appearance, dress conservatively, and stick to a regimented life. Even when adventuring, they follow their routine the best of their ability. Creatures descended from devils tend to use rules for their benefit, manipulating the system and taking advantage of legal loopholes. Descendants of archons practice the gentler aspects of regimen, living lives in as organized a fashion as possible.<br>Characters with the Axiomatic Bloodline feat tend to be organized and consistent; they generally look down on abnormality or spontaneity. As such, those with lawful blood excel at spells that locate items and creatures as well as spells that return things to their proper place or shape.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your ancestry gives you a bonus spell known at each spell level, starting at 1st, from the following list.</p><ol><li><em>Detect chaos</em></li><li><em>Locate object</em></li><li><em>Magic circle against chaos</em></li><li><em>Locate creature</em></li><li><em>Dismissal</em></li><li><em>True seeing</em></li><li><em>Forcecage</em></li><li><em>Discern location</em></li><li><em>Dominate monster</em></li></ol><p>
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If a character takes this feat any time after 1st level and has already learned any of the spells on this list in the class to which she applies this feat, she gains no additional spells known at those spell levels. This restriction does not apply if she learned any of these spells as a member of another spellcasting class.<br>Characters with this feat cannot learn or cast spells with the chaotic descriptor, and all such spells are removed from the spell lists of all their spellcasting classes.

            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If you already have the frightful moan ability (see the ghost&apos;s special attacks, <a href="../../monsters/templates/ghost.shtml">Ghost Template</a>), instead of the normal benefits of this feat, the DC to resist your frightful moan ability increases by 2.

        <p>Your spells deal extra damage to a particular type of creature.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you cast a spell that deals damage against a specific creature type, you deal an extra 2d6 points of damage. For example, a <em>giant bane lightning bolt</em> cast by an 8th-level caster would deal the usual 8d6 points of damage to any non-giant in its path but would deal 10d6 points of damage against giants. This feat has no effect on spells that do not deal hit point damage, and the source and type of the damage remains the same. This feat cannot be used to increase the amount of healing dealt to undead by <em>inflict light wounds</em> and similar spells, but it can add to the damage dealt by casting <em>cure light wounds</em> on an undead creature.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can take this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, you must apply its effects to a different type of creature: aberrations, animals, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, giants, humanoids, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, oozes, outsiders, plants, undead, or vermin. If you choose humanoids, you must select a particular type of humanoid, such as dwarf or orc.

            <br><strong>Region</strong>: Taer
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can execute a charge by simply dropping from a height of at least 5 feet above your opponent. For example, a ledge 10 feet above the floor of a cavern would suffice for jumping on a Medium-sized creature, while a ledge 15 feet high is required for a jumping on a Large creature. You can&apos;t jump from more than 30 feet above your opponent, nor can you effectively battle jump while under the influence of a <em>fly</em> or <em>levitate</em> spell or effect, as you have to hurl yourself down on your foe.<br>If you hit, you can choose either to deal double damage with a melee weapon or natural attack or to attempt a trip attack. You are treated as one size category larger than normal if you try to trip your opponent with the battle jump. After you attack, you take falling damage as normal for the distance you jumped. You are entitled to a Jump check (DC 15) to take less damage, as if you had fallen 10 feet less than you actually did. If you fail this Jump check, you fall prone 5 feet from your opponent.<br>You can also use Battle Jump to begin a grapple attempt instead of making a normal attack. If you do, you are treated as one size category larger than normal for the first grapple check following the battle jump.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Anybody can try to jump down on an enemy, but it is not considered a charge, and they do not gain double damage or the size bonus for the ensuing attack.

A creature gains a token whether the save succeeds or fails, but a creature that avoids a spell through spell resistance does not gain a token. Each Battle Magic Tactics token imposes a cumulative -1 penalty on saving throws against the spells of spellcasters that have this feat.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You are vulnerable to the following list of spells that affect animals, as well as those which affect your own creature type: <em>animal trance, calm animals, charm animal, dominate animal, hide from animals, hold animal</em>.

        <p>You rely on your charm and physical good looks to keep you safe from harm
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Fey
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: At 1st level, you may use your Charisma modifier instead of your Constitution modifier to determine bonus hit points. At each level thereafter, you use your Constitution modifier normally to determine bonus hit points, but you also gain +1 hit point for every point of permanent Charisma you gain. In addition, Charisma increases can retroactively increase the bonus hit points from your first level.<br>Should you suffer any Charisma decreases, your bonus hit points from your first level also decrease, and you lose any extra bonus hit points you have gained from Charisma increases. These hit point decreases persist for as long as your Charisma decrease lasts.<br><em>Example: Suppose Pinsom starts out at 1st level with a Charisma score of 15. Pinsom gets +2 bonus hit points at first level (because his Charisma modifier is +2). When he reaches 4th level, Pinsom add +1 to his Charisma score, giving him a Charisma modifier of +3. Pinsom gains +1 hit from his first hit die (due to his increased Charisma modifier) and +1 bonus hit point because he has added a point of Charisma. If Pinsom later takes 3 points of Charisma damage, his Charisma score drops to 13. He now gets only +1 hit from his first hit die (a net loss of 2 hit points) and he loses the +1 hit point he gained from adding a point of Charisma at 4th level, for a total loss of 3 hit points.</em>
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Your Constitution modifier determines your bonus hit points at every character level.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: You may take this feat only as a 1st-level character.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Augment Summoning, Spell Focus (conjuration).
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you summon a creature or creatures using any <em>summon</em> spell, you can opt to summon a version of the creature from an extraplanar frostfell. If you do so, the summoned creature gains the cold subtype, and its natural attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of cold damage. <br>Creatures with the fire subtype can never be enhanced with the cold subtype in this manner.

        <p>Cover does little to reduce the effectiveness of your spells.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Bend Spell reduces all benefits from cover for creatures effected by a spell. Target creatures gain no cover bonuses to Armor Class against a spell enhanced by the Bend Spell feat, and any saving throws made by creatures in the enhanced spell&apos;s area of effect gain no cover bonuses. This feat does not allow the spell to affect any target that would not normally be affected (for example, a target with total cover still cannot be affected).<br>A spell enhanced by Bend Spell uses up a slot one level higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

        <p>You have learned to take complete advantage of the animal forms you can assume.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Base attack bonus +4, wild shape class feature.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This feat allows the use of three tactical maneuvers, each of which requires that you attempt a charge attack in the round immediately following your shift into animal form using wild shape. If you have the Swift Wild Shape feat, you can attempt the charge in the same round as you change forms.<br><em>Pouncing Charge</em>: You can make a full attack after you charge, as if you had the pounce ability. If the animal form you have assumed normally has the pounce ability, your bonus on attack rolls when charging increases to +3.<br><em>Striking Charge</em>: For the purpose of this charge attack only, you gain an extra 5 feet of reach by suddenly striking forward with your head and neck. You must assume a serpentine animal form to employ this maneuver.<br><em>Twisting Charge</em>: You can change direction during a charge, as long as you move at least 10 feet both before and after you turn. You must assume an animal form with four or more legs to employ this maneuver.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: You can make only a single attack after charging, with a +2 bonus on attack rolls. You can charge only in a straight line.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to prepare and cast <em>animate dead</em>, required sacrifice.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your familiar gains either the zombie or skeleton template. Its abilities and qualities alter to conform with the template. You no longer gain the special ability it once granted you (such as the +3 on Listen checks granted by a bat) and as a mindless undead it never develops the speak with master or speak with animals of its own kind abilities. However, you gain the ability to draw upon its supernatural vitality when it is within arms reach. A skeleton familiar grants you DR 5/bludgeoning and a zombie familiar grants you DR 5/slashing.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A wizard may select Betrayal of the Spirit Linked as a wizard bonus feat<br><strong>Sacrifice</strong>: You must kill your own familiar and animate it as either a zombie or skeleton (your choice). Due to the intervention of your patron you suffer none of the ill effects normally incurred by the death of a familiar. Even if you subsequently repent and try to summon a new familiar only another undead creature answers your call.

        <p>You can craft magic items that use bound elementals for special effects, including weapons, armor, airships, and elemental galleons. 
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Craft Wondrous Item, caster level 9th. 
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Crafting an item with a bound elemental is similar to making a wondrous item, except that calling and binding an elemental is an integral part of creating the item. All bound-elemental items have a <em>planar binding</em> spell as a prerequisite, but simply casting the spell as part of the item creation is not sufficient. You must cast the spell normally, using the item that is to hold the elemental and a Khyber dragonshard as a receptacle. The elemental receives its normal saving throw to resist. While the elemental resides in the receptacle, you must compel it to accept bondage in the item by making an opposed Charisma check, as specified in the <em>lesser planar binding</em> spell description. <br>If you are an artificer, this feat allows you to cast a planar binding spell by successfully emulating it with a Use Magic Device check (DC 20 +caster level), but only when you attempt to craft a bound-elemental item. In this case, your effective caster level equals your Use Magic Device check result -20 for the purpose of opposing the elemental&apos;s attempts to escape. See pages 265-267 (<strong>Eberron Campaign</strong>) for examples of bound-elemental items and vessels.

        <p>You can channel electrical energy directly into your opponents nervous system. This effect not only causes physical damage but also disrupts the target&apos;s coordination.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any two spells with the electricity descriptor, control body.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This feat can be applied to any spell or power with the electricity descriptor. Anyone damaged by an effect enhanced by Bioelectrical Surge twitches uncontrollably or can make only grossly exaggerated and jerky motions.<br>For each 10 points of electricity damage the target takes from such a spell or power, it must make a successful Fortitude save or take 2 points of Dexterity damage. The DC for this save equals the save DC for the spell or power (or the save DC it would otherwise have if no save is allowed). A creature with no discernible anatomy (such as an ooze, construct, or undead) or a creature that is immune to electricity damage is immune to the effects of this feat.<br>To apply Bioelectrical Surge to a spell, the caster must expend 3 power points per spell level. To apply it to a psionic power, the manifester must spend 1 spell level per power level.

        <h1>Bind Vestige</h1>

        <p>You know how to make pacts with otherworldly spirits called vestiges.
            <br><strong>Clan</strong>: By employing a short ritual, you can contact a vestige and make a pact with it. You are treated as a 1st-level binder for this purpose, regardless of your character level. Thus, only 1st-level vestiges are available to you, and you can bind to only one vestige at a time. Furthermore, unlike characters with the soul binding class feature, you gain only one power from the vestige you bind, as given on the page 74, <strong>Tome of Magic</strong>.<br>To contact a vestige, you must draw its unique seal visibly on a surface (generally the ground), making the image at least 5 feet across. Drawing a seal requires the ability to mark a surface and 10 consecutive rounds of concentration, and the act provokes attacks of opportunity. A seal not used within 1 minute of its drawing loses all potency, and you must draw a new one to contact the vestige. A vestige might also have other requirements for contact, as noted in its entry (see page 18, <strong>Tome of Magic</strong>).<br>Once the seal is drawn, you must perform a ritual requiring a full-round action to summon the corresponding vestige. During this time, you must touch the seal and call out to the vestige using both its name and title. The ritual fails if you cannot be heard (for example, if you are within the area of a <em>silence</em> spell). Otherwise, a manifestation of the vestige appears in the seal&apos;s space as soon as you finish the ritual. This image is not the actual vestige; it is merely a figment - an illusion that cannot harm or be harmed by any creature. Creatures that interact with the image or study it carefully automatically recognize it as illusory. The summoned image ignores everyone but you, and if you fail to address it for 1 round, it disappears whence it came. The vestige speaks in whatever language you used to call it.<br> To make a pact with your summoned vestige, you must make a binding check (1d20 + your effective binder level + your Cha modifier). This process requires 1 minute, but you can choose to make a rushed binding check as a full-round action at a -10 penalty. The DC for this check is provided in the description of each vestige. You must make your perilous pact alone; others cannot aid you in any way. Whether the binding check succeeds or fails, you gain the power granted by the vestige for 24 hours. During that time you cannot rid yourself of the vestige unless you possess the <a href="../../charbuild/feat/Expel_Vestige" onclick="return popitup(&apos;../../charbuild/feat/Expel_Vestige&apos;)">Expel Vestige</a> feat. If you fail the binding check, however, vestige influences your personality and your actions, and you are said to have made a poor pact. (Specifically, the vestige&apos;s presence changes your general demeanor, and it can force you to perform or refrain from certain actions. The influence of each vestige is described in its individual entry.) If your binding check is successful, the vestige has no control over your actions and does not influence your personality. In this case, you are said to have made a good pact.<br>While under the influence of a vestige, you must adhere to its requirements to the best of your ability. If you are conscious and free-willed and you encounter a situation in which you cannot or will not refrain from a prohibited action or perform a required one, you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and checks until the vestige leaves you.<br>As long as you are bound to a vestige, you manifest a specific physical sign of its presence, as given in its entry. This sign is not an illusory or shapechanging effect, and someone true seeing perceives it just as it is. You can hide a sign mundane or magical means without penalty.<br>The vestige is bound to your soul by the pact. It cannot be targeted or expelled by any means except the Expel Vestige feat nor can it be suppressed except by an <em>antimagic field</em> or similar effect.<br>The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against any supernatural powers granted by a vestige is 10 + 1/2 your effective binder level + your Cha modifier.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Characters who have the ability to bind vestiges through other means (such as the soul binding class feature) cannot take this feat. If you become a binder after taking the feat you lose its benefit.

        <p>You have mastered fighting with a sai in your off-hand to counter other two-weapon fighters.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Focus (sai), base attack bonus +5.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As part of a full-attack action with a sai in your off-hand, you may make an opposed attack roll using your off-hand weapon against an opponent who is also using two weapons. If successful, you pin your opponent&apos;s off-hand weapon and he may not use it on his next action. Due to the design of the sai, you receive a +4 bonus on the attack roll made to pin your opponent&apos;s off-hand weapon. If you have more than one attack with your off-hand weapon, you may attempt to pin your opponent&apos;s off-hand weapon more than once. If successful, you lose any additional attacks you might receive with your off-hand until your next turn. If your opponent moves outside your reach, this restriction is removed. Your opponent can choose to drop the weapon instead of suffering this restriction.

At any time before the end of the same turn in which you activate this ability, you can make a melee touch attack as a swift action. The poison renders the target fatigued and deals 1d8 points of damage per level of the spell slot converted; 10 rounds later, the same effect repeats. Each tune, a successful Fortitude save (DC: 10 + the spell slot&apos;s level + your Cha modifier) negates the fatigue and halves the damage.

        <p>Your study of the sinister knowledge and spellcasting techniques of the long-dead Nightlords of Moil makes your necromancy spells especially potent.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spell Focus (necromancy), caster level 7th.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Any necromancy spell you cast can be cast instead as a Moilian spell, dealing an extra 1d6 points of negative energy damage +1d6 per two spell levels (+1d6 for 1st-level spells, +2d6 for 2nd- or 3rd-level spells, and so on). If the spell normally allows a saving throw, the target takes half the negative energy damage on a successful save, regardless of the outcome of the save on the spell&apos;s normal effect.<br>In addition to its normal spell components, a Moilian spell requires the creation and expenditure of a Moilian runebone - a small human bone (often a finger bone) scribed with carefully prepared arcane markings. Only a character trained in the Black Lore of Moil knows the secrets of creating a runebone, which takes 1 hour to craft and requires special inks and powders costing 25 gp per die of negative energy damage to be generated. For example, a runebone capable of adding 3d6 points of negative energy damage to a spell costs 75 gp to craft.<br>While the maximum negative energy damage dealt by a Moilian spell is based on the spell&apos;s level, the actual damage is limited by the runebone. For example, if a sorcerer casts <em>finger of death</em> (a 7th-level spell, so normally +4d6) with a 75-gp (3d6) runebone, the spell deals only 3d6 points of additional negative energy damage.<br>A Moilian spell uses a spell slot of the spell&apos;s normal level.

        <p>You can call upon negative energy to infuse normal water around you, transforming it into the dark, cold water found the bottom of deepest ocean trenches. This feat is favored by the clerics of wicked sea gods and the masters of the deep pelagic abysses.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to channel negative energy.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: By expending a daily rebuke undead attempt, you can infuse the water around you for a 30-foot radius with negative energy. The water darkens and becomes bitterly cold for 10 minutes. Those entering the water who are not protected from cold must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d6 non-lethal damage. This damage is the same kind of damage dealt by cold weather and is only taken once (as it would have to last a full hour to deal damage again). However, those leaving the area and then returning to it must make another saving throw or take further damage, since their warmed bodies are chilled once again. Those wearing warm clothing or otherwise protected from the cold (whether by any amount of resistance to cold or the endure elements spell) take no damage from this effect.<br>Additionally, those within the area of affected water gain concealment. Those with the ability to channel negative energy are immune to the cold effects of this feat but are still subject to its concealment miss chance.

The penalty you take on your attack must be -5 or more. If the attack succeeds, instead of taking damage, your opponent must make a Fortitude save or become blind for 1d4 rounds. The DC for the Fortitude save equals so plus the value of the penalty you took on the attack (minimum DC 15).<br><em>Weaken Gaze</em>: To use this maneuver, you must use a full-round action to make an attack with a melee weapon using your Power Attack feat against a creature with a gaze attack. The penalty you take on your attack must be -5 or more. If the attack succeeds, you deal normal damage and also degrade one of the target&apos;s gaze attacks. For the next 10 rounds, the creature&apos;s gaze attack save DC decreases by 2. Each successful Weaken Gaze attack further reduces the save DC by 2. Against a monster with more than one gaze attack, such as a beholder, this maneuver only affects one gaze attack at a time. In such an instance, you choose which gaze attack you affect.<br><em>Eye Gouge</em>: To use this maneuver you must use a full-round action to make an attack with a melee weapon using your Power Attack feat against a creature with a gaze attack. This maneuver provokes attacks of opportunity. If you take damage from an attack of opportunity the maneuver is disrupted and your turn ends. Otherwise, you may make an attack using your Power Attack feat. The penalty you take on your attack must be -5 or more. If the attack succeeds, your opponent takes normal damage and must also make a Fortitude save or lose the use of its gaze attack for 1d4 rounds. The DC for the Fortitude save equals 10 plus the value of the penalty you took on the attack (minimum DC 15). Against a monster with more than one gaze attack, such as a beholder, this maneuver only affects one gaze attack at a time. In such an instance, you choose which gaze attack you affect.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Constructs, oozes, and creatures without visual organs (including most undead) are immune to the effects of these maneuvers.<br>A fighter may select Blinding Strike as one of his fighter bonus feats.

Determine what your AC would be without your spiked shield and the AC bonus for fighting defensively. If an opponent&apos;s attack hits against this lower AC but misses against your actual AC, the foe strikes your shield, allowing you to deflect his attack in such a way as to leave him vulnerable to your counter. On your next action you gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against your chosen foe with your spiked shield.<br><em>Spiked Slam</em>: As a full-round action when you are wielding a spiked shield, you can opt to make only a single attack at your best base attack bonus. You brace yourself behind your spiked shield, drive yourself forward, and slam into your foe. You enter your foe&apos;s space, which provokes attacks of opportunity. In return, your attack deals extra damage equal to twice your Strength and an additional amount based on your size (see below). After making this attack, you stumble back into the square you occupied just before making this attack. Until the start of your next turn, you do not threaten any squares.</p><table class="table" style="width:30em"><tr><td><strong>Size</strong></td><td><strong>Additional Damage</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>1d4</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>1d6</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>1d8</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>2d6</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>2d8</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>3d6</td></tr></table><p>

        <p>One of the creature&apos;s spell-like abilities is harder to resist than it would otherwise be.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The saving throw Difficulty Class (DC) of a boosted spell-like ability is increased by +2. Each of a creature&apos;s spell-like abilities can be boosted three time a day, though the feat does not allow the creature to exceed its normal usage limiting for any ability. Thus, if a succubus chooses to boost its <em>suggestion</em> ability, it can use a boosted <em>suggestion</em> up to three times a day. Thereafter, it could use its <em>suggestion</em> ability again normally (since it can use <em>suggestion</em> at will), or it could boost another of its spell-like abilities, such as <em>charm monster</em>.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to each of its spell-like abilities three additional times per day.

        <p>You have learned to marry the power of lightning and thunder in your electricity and sonic spells.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Knowledge (nature) 4 ranks, Energy Substitution (electricity).
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you cast a spell with either the electricity descriptor or the sonic descriptor that deals hit point damage, you can declare that spell to be a spell of the three thunders, with half its damage dealt as electricity damage and half dealt as sonic damage. In addition, the spell concludes with a mighty thunderclap that stuns all creatures that take damage from the spell for I round unless they succeed on a Fortitude save, then knocks stunned creatures prone unless they succeed on a Reflex save (both saves at the same DC as the base spell). Channeling the three thunders is costly, though, and you are automatically dazed for 1 round after doing so.<br>A three thunders spell uses a spell slot of the spell&apos;s normal level. In addition, its descriptor changes to include both energy types - for example, a lightning bolt of the three thunders is an evocation &lt;electricity, sonic&gt; spell.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: All Knowledge checks you make are treated as trained checks, even if you don&apos;t have any ranks in the specific skill. If you have at least one rank in the specific Knowledge skill in question, you gain a +1 bonus on the check.

        <p>You can allow a person adjacent to you to breathe water.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Aquatic elf or water genasi, base Will save +2.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a free action on your turn, you can select one creature within 5 feet of you and give that creature the ability to breathe water as easily as you do. This supernatural ability renews automatically for that creature until you direct the ability to another creature or withdraw your power from it (a free action). The creature&apos;s ability to breathe water ends immediately if you are separated by more than 5 feet or if you die, at which point the creature begins to drown if it is still underwater. This ability does not hamper the creature&apos;s ability to breathe air, nor does it change the creature&apos;s ability (or inability) to swim.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can select this feat more than once. Each time you take this feat, you can affect an additional creature with this ability. All such creatures need to remain within 5 feet of you (not each other). If one creature exceeds the range of this power, its subsequent distress has no effect on the other creatures you are helping.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spellcaster level 3rd+
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can create a potion of any spell of 3rd level or lower that you know and that targets a creature or creatures. Brewing a potion takes 1 day. When you create a potion, you set the caster level. The caster level must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Illumian.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a standard action, you can increase the illumination from your illumian sigils to provide a bright glow. Your sigils shed illumination equivalent to a <em>daylight</em> spell. The brighter light lasts as long as you concentrate, and for 1 round thereafter.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: An illumian&apos;s sigils ordinarily emit a 5-foot radius of shadowy illumination, equivalent to a candle.

        <p>Your dedication to Ilmater&apos;s philosophy has given you the power to take attacks directed at others.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Wis 13, member of the Broken Ones monk order
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As an immediate action, you can intervene on behalf of an adjacent ally (of your size or smaller) who is under attack. When you activate this feat, you and the ally switch spaces. If there is not enough space for this to occur, you cannot activate the feat. Then, you suffer the harmful effect as if you were the intended target; the ally is unaffected by it. In addition to the obvious harmful effect this has upon you, this action is a drain on your personal energy. Once the effect of the intervention is resolved, you become fatigued. You cannot use this feat if you are exhausted or if you are immune to fatigue.<br>You can choose to activate this feat after the success or failure of the harmful effect is determined, but you must activate it before the extent of the effect is determined and/or applied to the ally.<br>Example: If an adjacent ally is attacked, you could wait until after the attack roll (and confirmation roll: if the attack is a critical threat) is made to activate the feat, but you would have to activate it before damage is rolled. If the adjacent creature also benefits from a miss chance, you could wait until after that roll was made to activate the feat.<br>Example: If an adjacent creature is within the area of a <em>lightning bolt</em> spell, you could wait until the creature rolls its saving throw (and checks its spell resistance, if any), but you would have to activate the feat before the spell&apos;s damage is rolled. If an adjacent creature is targeted by an attack that deals a fixed amount of damage, such as a maximized <em>magic missile</em> spell, you would choose to activate this feat after the spell hit the target, but before damage was applied.<br>By activating this feat, you give up any opportunity to avoid the harmful effect normally allowed by a saving throw, spell resistance, AC, or concealment. If the effect allows a saving throw or spell resistance, you automatically fail the save or spell resistance check. If the effect requires an attack roll, it automatically hits you (and if it scored a critical hit, it automatically scores a critical hit on you), even if you would normally benefit from a miss chance against the attack. Any immunities or resistances you have apply normally; for example, if you are immune to critical hits, an attacker can&apos;t score a critical hit on you just because he scored one on the ally.<br>If you can&apos;t physically interact with or manipulate objects (for instance, if you are incorporeal or in gaseous form, or if either you or the ally, but not both of you, are ethereal), you can&apos; switch places with the ally and thus can&apos;t activate this feat. It should go without saying, but if you are incapable of taking an action (dazed, paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, and so on), you can&apos;t use this feat.

        <p>You have tapped into your bronze dragon blood and can channel arcane energy to repel foes. 
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Draconic Heritage (bronze), sorcerer level 3rd. 
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a swift action, you can spend an arcane spell slot to force nearby enemies to move away from you. Each opponent within 30 feet of you must begin its next turn by moving at least 5 feet (1 square) away from you. The direction of movement doesn&apos;t matter, as long as it takes the foe farther from you than the square in which it started. Unless the enemy designates the movement as a 5-foot step, this movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. A successful Will save (DC 10 + the spell slot&apos;s level + your Cha modifier) negates this effect. This is a mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effect.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: If you use your Power Attack feat to increase your damage with a bludgeoning weapon, you can attempt a brutal strike. You must declare your intention before making your attack. If the attack hits and your opponent takes damage, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + your extra damage from the Power Attack feat on the attack) or be sickened for 1 round.<br>You can use this feat once per round during your attack action.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Harden Energy.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You may add telekinetic force to any spell or power already enhanced by the Harden Energy feat.<br>An effect enhanced by Bull Blast can perform a bull rush against any opponent in its area. The spell&apos;s area or effect determines the direction of the bull rush: A line or cone pushes targets back along its length, but a spread or burst pushes them out to the edge of its radius. The enhanced spell or power has an effective Strength equal to its save DC + 1 per die of force damage it deals. Even a target that makes the appropriate saving throw to avoid some or all of the spell&apos;s damage is still subject to the bull rush.<br>To apply Bull Blast to a spell, the caster must expend 3 power points per spell level. To apply it to a psionic power, the manifester must spend 1 spell level per power level. Both of these costs are in addition to the cost of the Harden Energy feat.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can choose one creature whose spell resistance you failed to overcome in the last round with your caster level check. The next time you try to overcome that creature&apos;s spell resistance, you gain a +1 morale bonus to the level check to overcome the creature&apos;s spell resistance. This bonus increases by +1 after each such failed check (to a maximum bonus of +10), so after three failed level checks, you would gain a +3 bonus to the next level check to bypass that target&apos;s spell resistance. You can apply the bonus from this feat to only one creature at a time. The bonus stacks with that provided by both Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Penetration.<br>If more than minute passes before you cast another spell at the creature that requires a level check to overcome spell resistance, you lose the bonus. You also lose this bonus as soon as you successfully bypass the chosen creature&apos;s spell resistance or cast a spell that doesn&apos;t affect the chosen creature (so if you cast a spell that targets another creature or in an area that doesn&apos;t affect the chosen creature).

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: By reducing your sneak attack damage by two damage dice, you can deal sneak attack damage to a creature linked with your target from a class ability - such as a druid ranger&apos;s animal companion, a sorcerer or wizard&apos;s familiar, or a paladin&apos;s special mount. Only your sneak attack damage (that which remains after subtracting two dice to use this feat) applies, and that damage only affects the target&apos;s linked creature - not your target. The base damage of your weapon, your Strength bonus, poison, and similar types of damage do not transfer and apply to your target normally. A creature has a special connection to your target if it gains Hit Dice, hit points, or other abilities due to the target&apos;s level.

        <p>Your powers sometimes bypass barriers.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can attempt to manifest your powers against targets that are sheltered behind a wall or force effect. Your power briefly skips through the Astral Plane to bypass the barrier.<br>The strength and thickness of the barrier determine your chance of success. To successfully bypass the barrier with your power, you make a Psicraft check against a DC equal to 10 + the hardness of the barrier + 1 per foot of thickness (minimum 1). Assign a hardness of 20 to barriers without a hardness rating, such as force effects (or a wall of ectoplasm). Force walls or walls of ectoplasm are assumed to have less than 1 foot of thickness unless noted otherwise.<br>If a power requires line of sight (which includes most powers that affect a target or targets instead of an area), you cannot manifest it as a burrowing power unless you can somehow see the target, such as with clairvoyant sense.<br>Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power&apos;s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.

This bonus caster level allows you to exceed the normal maximum damage allowed by a spell, so an 11th-level caster of the Air tradition creates an 11d6 lightning bolt instead of a 10d6 lightning bolt. If you are a wizard, you may add a spell in your tradition to your spellbook for free when you become able to cast it.

For example, you cannot sacrifice a 3rd-level spell slot if you can only manifest 2nd-level powers.

        <p>You can expend some of your musical abilities to increase the potency of your enchantment or illusion spells.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Bardic music, ability to cast arcane spells.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a swift action before casting a spell, you can attempt a Perform check (DC 15 + the level of the spell you intend to cast). If you succeed, you can sacrifice one of your daily uses of bardic music to increase the save DC of the next enchantment or illusion spell you cast in the same round by 2. If the Perform check fails, you still lose one daily use of bardic music but gain no benefit.<br>You can apply Captivating Melody only to spells cast by the same class that grants you your bardic music ability. For instance, if you are a multiclass bard/wizard, you can apply this feat to bard spells, but not to spells you cast as a wizard.

Make a Ride check at the conclusion of the move portion of the charge action. Prior to making the roll, determine the DC of the check: either DC 10 for a chance to deal 2 extra points of damage or DC 20 for a chance to deal 4 extra points of damage.

        <p>One of your distant ancestors was a good outsider. The characteristics you display might depend in part on the kind of celestial heritage you have. <br>Descendants of devas or archons tend to be very decisive - quick to judge and quick to act. Characters with couatl or lillend ancestors are often physically beautiful, and they tend to favor snakes and other reptiles as familiars. Titan-blooded descendants are usually taller than average for their races, and they usually have boisterous personalities. The most common sources of celestial blood, however, are minor good gods or the avatars of more powerful beings. A sorcerer descended from such a line can be very passionate about his faith, whether he follows his ancestor&apos;s religion or not.<br>Characters with the Celestial Bloodline feat are usually good-aligned, although not always. Their yearn for adventure stems either from a desire to aid others, an innate need to combat evil, or both. As such, celestial-blooded characters tend to focus their spell selections on good- or neutral-aligned spells that aid others.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your ancestry gives you a bonus spell known at each spell level, starting at 1st, according to the following list.</p><ul><li>1. Protection from evil</li><li>2. Daylight</li><li>3. Magic circle against evil</li><li>4. Rainbow pattern</li><li>5. Dismissal</li><li>6. Guards and wards</li><li>7. Sequester</li><li>8. Sunburst</li><li>9. Summon monster IX (good outsiders only)</li></ul><p>
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If a character takes this feat any time after 1st level and has already learned any of the spells on this list in the class that granted her access to this feat, she gains no additional spells known at those spell levels. This restriction does not apply if she learned any of these spells as a member of another spellcasting class.<br>Characters with this feat cannot learn or cast spells with the evil descriptor, and all such spells are removed from the spell lists of all their spellcasting classes.

The familiar uses the basic statistics for a creature of its kind, as given in the Monster Manual or Book of Exalted Deeds, except as noted below.<br>Hit Dice: For effects related to Hit Dice, use the master&apos;s level or the familiar&apos;s normal total, whichever is higher. <br>Hit Points: One-half the master&apos;s total or the familiar&apos;s normal total, whichever is higher. <br>Attacks: Use the master&apos;s base attack bonus or the familiar&apos;s, whichever is better. <br>Saving Throws: Use the master&apos;s base save bonuses if they are better than the familiar&apos;s. <br>Familiar Special Abilities: Use the information in the Familiars sidebar on pages 52-53 of the Player&apos;s Handbook to determine additional abilities as you would for a normal familiar.

        <p>You are a member of one of the major noble houses of the former Great Kingdom.
            <br><strong>Region</strong>: Ablissa, North Kingdom, Solnor Compact.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The benefits of this feat depend upon the Celestial House to which you belong. Unless your DM allows otherwise, your rank is very minor and grants no game benefits other than those listed below. Membership in your family may have intense roleplaying repercussions and benefits, at the discretion of the DM.<br><em>Cranden</em>: You receive maximum starting gold at 1st level. Due to the diplomatic expertise and sterling reputation of your noble house, you receive a +3 bonus on all Diplomacy checks. Unless otherwise noted, NPCs in the former Great Kingdom have an initial attitude of friendly toward you.<br><em>Darmen</em>: The weapons of choice for your mercantile house are the poisoned words that have killed far more enemies than poisoned blades. When caught in a lie due to an unsuccessful Bluff check, you get an immediate follow-up opposed Bluff check to cover up the &quot;misstatement&quot; with double-speak. If this Bluff check is successful, ignore the original failed result - the Bluff attempt goes off successfully, leaving the victim none the wiser. Unless otherwise noted, NPCs in the former Great Kingdom have an initial attitude of friendly toward you if they are members of the middle or upper class. Lower-class serfs understand all too well the contempt most members of House Darmen feel for their &quot;breed,&quot; and are initially unfriendly toward you. <br><em>Garasteth</em>: The arcane legacy of Aerdy&apos;s House Garasteth is known throughout the Flanaess. Wizard is a favored class for you. A multiclass Garasteth&apos;s wizard class does not count when determining whether she takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing. You also get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks. Because most folk fear the magical might of your house, NPCs in the former Great Kingdom have an initial attitude of friendly toward you.<br><em>Naelax</em>:You share the bloodline of Ivid the Undying, the mad undead Overking who brought the once-mighty Great Kingdom to its knees. You receive a +2 bonus on all Intimidate checks. Thanks to an unholy pact between Overking Ivid I and a fiend, you enjoy a special relationship with evil outsiders. You have a continuous true seeing ability, as the spell (caster level 16th), but the ability works only against the cloaking spells of demons and devils. This is a super-natural ability. Due to your family&apos;s ghastly reputation, NPCs in the former Great Kingdom have an initial attitude of unfriendly toward you.<br><em>Rax-Nyrond:</em> The true heirs of the House of Rax died out long ago, but several illegitimate and minor branches of the family survive. The Rax legacy is not particularly proud, being filled with a succession of incompetents and half-wits. Regardless, the house managed to hoard a great deal of political influence during its time at the head of the Great Kingdom. As an heir of that tradition, you receive a +3 bonus on Gather Information checks, and all checks take 1d2 hours. Unless otherwise noted, NPCs in the former Great Kingdom have an initial attitude of friendly toward you.<br><em>Torquaan</em>: The financial might of House Torquaan extends far beyond the borders of the former Great Kingdom. Your family&apos;s reputation for squeezing the most out of a gold coin by employing deceit, trickery, cruelty, and good old-fashioned business skills allows you a 10% discount on all purchases made anywhere the influence of House Torquaan is known. The DM is free to disallow this discount outside the former Great Kingdom or in locales openly hostile to House Torquaan. Since many folk see your kinsmen as greedy plutocrats, NPCs in the former Great Kingdom have an initial attitude of unfriendly toward you.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You must select this feat as a 1st-level character.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Add one good-aligned creature to the list of creatures for each summon monster spell that you can cast, (Work with the DM to select creatures appropriate to the spell&apos;s list of summonable creatures.) Each time you gain the ability to cast a new summon monster spell, you may add one good-aligned creature to the list.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Without this feat, adding a creature to your summoning list requires you to remove one that is already on the list.

        <p>You have trained to use your large body and unique physiology against your foes. Much like a humanoid knight mounted on a warhorse, you have learned how to knock down opponents and ride over them in combat.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Centaur, Dex 15.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you attempt to overrun an opponent, your target may not choose to avoid you. You may make one hoof attack against any target you knock down (remember that prone targets take a -4 penalty to Armor Class). See Overrun, page 157 of the Player&apos;s Handbook.

        <p>You can metamagically enhance your spells with your mind.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any metamagic feat.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose a metamagic feat you know. You can expend power points to create a prerequisite spell slot needed to prepare a spell modified by that metamagic feat. The power point cost equals double the needed spell slot&apos;s level (the level of the spell needed to prepare or spontaneously cast the desired spell with the desired metamagic feat applied). You also must devote a spell slot of the spell&apos;s normal level to this spell. You cannot enhance a spell in this way beyond the level of the highest-level spell you can cast. For example, a psion 5/wizard 5 can - instead of using his only 3rd-level spell slot preparing a maximized <em>magic missile</em> - spend 6 power points to maximize the spell as a 1st-level spell (using up one of his 1st-level spell slots to do so). A sorcerer must spend a full-round action casting a cerebremetamagic spell.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spellcaster level 1st, must undergo the Rite of the Blot.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You are now referred to as a cerebrant, and you learn a constellation of new cerebrotic spells (see Cerebrotic Spell List). If you are a caster who prepares spells, you can pen each of these spells into your spellbook when you are high enough level to do so as additional bonus spells known. Whether you cast spells spontaneously or prepare spells, you can&apos;t cast any cerebrotic spells you know if you are not high enough level to cast them normally.<br>In addition to being able to learn cerebrotic spells, you gain a +2 bonus on your saving throws versus any effect generated by a creature of the Far Realm or by any cerebrosis spell. You don&apos;t gain this bonus when making saving throws required by any cerebrotic spell you attempt to escalate (as described in each spell description).
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Upon taking this feat, you become plagued with persistent, awful dreams that you can&apos;t recall with perfect clarity but which leave you drawn and pale with sleeplessness. Sometimes you remember snippets of the dream but then shudder and push them out of your mind. Your nightmare-riddled sleep undermines your Constitution score, saddling you with a permanent -1 penalty.

        <p>You can manifest powers that arc to hit other targets in addition to the primary target.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see <a href="../../charbuild/skills/concentration.shtml#psionics">Concentration skill</a> description). You can chain any power that affects a single target and that deals either acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. After the primary target is struck, the power can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your manifester level (maximum twenty). The secondary arcs each strike one target and deal half as much damage as the primary one did (round down). Each target gets to make a saving throw, if one is allowed by the power. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in the area, for example).<br>Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6.

        <p>You can cast spells that arc to other targets in addition to the primary target.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any metamagic feat.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Any spell that specifies a single target and has a range greater than touch can be chained so as to affect that primary target normally, then arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). Each arc affects one secondary target chosen by you, all of which must be within 30 feet of the primary target, and none of which can be affected more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.<br>If the chained spell deals damage, the secondary targets each take half as much damage as the primary target (rounded down) and can attempt Reflex saving throws for half damage (whether the spell allows the original target a save or not). For spells that don&apos;t deal damage, the save DCs against arcing effects are reduced by 4. For example, if a 10th-level wizard normally casts <em>cause fear</em> at DC 14, a <em>chained cause fear</em> could target a goblin chieftain at DC 14 and up to ten of his nearby guards at DC 10.<br>A chained spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

You immediately make an attack roll against the secondary target, at a -2 penalty. If the attack hits, you deal damage normally.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A rogue with Chakram Ricochet can deal sneak attack damage to both targets if they are within 30 feet and denied their Dexterity bonus to AC.

If you succeed, you can sacrifice a spell slot or prepared spell instead of using a charge.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your effective bard level increases by +4 for the purposes of determining which bardic music abilities you can use. This feat can&apos;t increase your effective bard level beyond your Hit Dice. However, if you can&apos;t benefit from the full bonus immediately, but you later gain non-bard Hit Dice, you may apply the rest of the bonus.<br>For example, a human 5th-level bard/3rd-level fighter who selects this feat would increase his effective bard level from 5th to 8th (since he has 8 HD), allowing him to use the suggestion ability and increasing his inspire courage bonus to +2. If he later gained another non-bard level, he would gain the remainder of the bonus and his effective bard level for bardic music abilities would become 9th (since he now has 9 HD).<br>This does not affect your spells per day or spells known. It only increases your effective bard level in regards to using your bardic music ability.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: <strong>Aura of Chaos</strong>: A character with at least one anarchic feat radiates an aura of chaos with a power equal to his character level (see the <a href="../../magic/spell/Detect_Chaos" onclick="return popitup(&apos;../../magic/spell/Detect_Chaos&apos;)" class="spell">detect chaos</a> spell), as if he were a cleric of a chaotic deity.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your effective barbarian level increases by +4 for the purposes of your rage ability. This feat can&apos;t increase your effective barbarian level beyond your Hit Dice. However, if you gain benefit from the full bonus immediately, but you later gain non-barbarian Hit Dice, you may apply the rest of the bonus.<br>For example, a human 8th-level barbarian/3rd-level fighter who selects this feat would increase his effective barbarian level from 8th to 11th (since he has 11 HD), allowing him access to greater rage. If he later gained another non-bard level, he would gain the remainder of the bonus and his effective barbarian level would become 12th (since he now has 12 HD), granting him the ability to rage four times per day. <br>This does not affect your trap sense, uncanny dodge, or any other barbarian class feature.

        <p>A few choice spells never stray far from your mind.
            <br><strong>Region</strong>: Any one Abyssal heritor feat, ability to prepare and cast spells.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per day, you can recall one spell with the chaotic descriptor that you had prepared and then cast.

You gain an additional daily use of this ability for every two abyssal heritor feats you possess.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Your mind frequently falls with chaotic thoughts, imposing a -2 penalty on Concentration checks.

        <p>Your skin has a noticeable blue tint and your left eye is pale blue (your right eye is some other color); these features identify you as an ally to the church of Iborighu and grant you supernatural qualities.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Patron deity must be Iborighu.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your left eye radiates faint evocation magic if it is viewed with a detect magic spell, and faint evil if viewed with a detect evil spell.<br>Cleric is now a favored class for you; the cleric class does not count when determining whether you take an experience point penalty for multiclassing.<br>Once per day, you can cause one creature within 30 feet that meets your gaze to become overwhelmed with a wave of supernatural cold. The target can resist the effects of this attack with a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier), otherwise it causes cold damage equal to your Charisma modifier + 3 (minimum 1 point of damage) and causes the victim to become fatigued. If you use this attack against someone who is fatigued, they instead become exhausted. Using this supernatural ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

You do not gain a replacement feat. If you later return to Iborighu&apos;s faithful and receive an <em>atonement</em> spell, you regain the benefits of the feat.

        <p>You can use the city itself to shape and enhance your spellcasting.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Caster level 3rd.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can modify any damaging spell you cast to incorporate the urban environment. When casting an offensive spell with an energy subtype - acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic - you can invest the spell with a portion of the city&apos;s spirit. In most cases, this investment is gritty and spectacular, drawing dirt, gravel, nails, and other nearby detritus into the spell effect. In other cases, the investiture is much more subtle, often merely changing the look of the spell. Only half the damage from a spell with the appropriate subtype is considered energy damage, and is thus subject to resistances or immunities. The remainder comes from the city itself, and is not subject to spell or energy resistances or immunities. This investiture only occurs for spells cast within urban environments, defined as any area above the size of a small town (see <a href="../../adventuring/dm-ing/towns.shtml">Generating Towns</a>).</p><p>For example, a wizard uses City Magic to cast a fireball at a creature with resistance to fire 15. The damage roll is 20, half of it fire damage and half &quot;city.&quot; Thus, the target takes 10 points of &quot;city&quot; damage instead of 5 points of fire damage. This feat is useless to spellcasters who cast their spells in a non-urban environment as defined above.</p><p>A spell modified using the City Magic feat uses a spell slot of the spell&apos;s normal level.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your breath weapon has its normal effect, but also clings to anything caught in its area. A clinging breath weapon lasts for 1 round. In the round after you breathe, the clinging breath weapon deals half of the damage it dealt in the previous round. Creatures that avoid damage from the breath weapon (such as creatures with the evasion special quality or incorporeal creatures) do not take the extra damage. For example, an old silver dragon uses its cold breath and deals 72 points of cold damage (or 36 points against a target that makes its save). In the following round, foes that failed their saves against the breath weapon initially take an additional 36 points of cold damage, and foes that succeeded on their saves take 18 points of cold damage.<br>A foe can take a full-round action to attempt to remove the clinging breath weapon before taking any additional damage. It takes a successful Reflex saving throw (same DC as your normal breath weapon) to remove the effect. Rolling around on the ground grants a +2 bonus on the saving throw, but leaves the foe prone. A clinging breath weapon cannot be removed or smothered by jumping into water. A clinging breath weapon can be magically dispelled (DC equal to your breath weapon save DC).<br>This feat only works on a breath weapon that has instantaneous duration and that deals some kind of damage, such as energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), ability damage, or negative levels.<br>When you use this feat, add +1 to the number of rounds you must wait before using your breath weapon again.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can apply this feat more than once to the same breath weapon. Each time you do, the clinging breath weapon lasts an additional round.

You must wear a cloak in order to utilize them.<br><em>Cloak Defense</em>: While you are fighting defensively, you can ate your cloak to confuse your foes. You hold it before your chest like a curtain, making it difficult for enemies to read your defensive moves. Your cloak grants you a +1 shield bonus to AC. If you use the total defense action, your cloak&apos;s shield bonus improves to +2. (Shield bonuses do not stack, making it likely that this maneuver is a poor option if you already carry a shield.)<br><em>Cloaked Strike</em>: You can use your cloak to hide a light weapon. To utilize this maneuver, on the first round you mast move adjacent to an opponent while you do not have a weapon in either hand. On the second round, you make a Bluff check opposed by your foe&apos;s Sense Motive check as you use a move action to draw your weapon. If this check succeeds, your opponent loses either his Dexterity bonus to AC or his shield bonus to AC (your choice) until the end of your current turn.<br><em>Whirling Cloak</em>: You can attempt to use your cloak to confuse your opponent. As a move action after successfully striking an opponent in melee, make a melee touch attack against that foe. If this attack hits, you whirl your cloak around him, temporarily ruining his defenses. Your opponent cannot make attacks of opportunity against a particular ally of your choice until the start of his next turn.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A fighter can select Combat Cloak Expert as one of his fighter bonus feats.

        <p>Your glowing personality and sharp performance abilities allow you to navigate the battlefield on sheer chutzpah alone. While others rely on swords and armor, you use your cutting wit and ability to manipulate others.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Bluff 8 ranks, Intimidate 8 ranks, Perform 8 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The Combat Panache feat grants you access to three special tactical maneuvers.<br><em>Fortuitous Tumble</em>: For a brief moment, you appear to let your guard down. As your foe swings at you, you slip our of the way, causing his attack to slam into one of his allies. By positioning yourself correctly and making yourself an appealing target, you dupe your foe into making a critical blunder. To use this maneuver, you must be successfully attacked by a foe. On your next turn, you can take a move action to make a Bluff check opposed by his Sense Motive check. If you succeed on the check, you can take an immediate action at the start of your foe&apos;s next turn and designate a different target for your opponent&apos;s next melee attack (which must be a creature it threatens).<br><em>Play Dead</em>: You crumple to the ground as if slain, luring your opponent into a false sense of security. As an immediate action after you are hit for at least 10 points of damage by a single attack, you can attempt to play dead. You drop prone and make a Bluff check opposed by your attacker&apos;s (or any other relevant observer&apos;s) Sense Motive check. If you succeed on this check, the observer assumes you are dead. If you subsequently rise and attack him in the same round, he loses any attack of opportunity he might have been entitled to against you, and he loses his Dexterity bonus to AC against the first attack that you make. You can use this ability once per encounter. Standing up after playing dead does not provoke attacks of opportunity.<br><em>Sneering Glower</em>: With just the right mix of your intimidating presence and your martial talents, you strike such fear into your target that he has difficulty fighting you effectively. On your next turn after you deal at least 1 point of damage to your opponent, you can make an Intimidate check against him as a move action. If you succeed on this check, your foe takes a penalty on his attack rolls against you equal to your Charisma bonus. You can gain this benefit against only one foe at a time; it lasts for the duration of the encounter or until you switch targets. If you designate a new target for this ability (by attempting a new Intimidate check against a different creature), the previous target no longer takes the penalty on his attack rolls against you. Opponents that are immune to the effects of the Intimidate skill, such as mindless creatures and those with immunity to fear, are immune to this maneuver.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A fighter can select Combat Panache as one of his fighter bonus feats.

        <p>You can respond quickly and repeatedly to opponents who let their defenses down.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When foes leave themselves open, you may make a number of additional attacks of opportunity equal to your Dexterity modifier. For example, a character with a Dexterity of 15 can make a total of three attacks of opportunity in a round - the one attack of opportunity any character is entitled to, plus two more attacks because of his +2 Dexterity bonus. If four goblins move through the character&apos;s threatened area, he can make attacks of opportunity against three of the four. You still only make one attack of opportunity per enemy. You may also make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A rogue with the Combat Reflexes feat still can only make one attack of opportunity in a round if he uses his <a href="../../charbuild/classes/rogue.shtml">opportunist ability</a>) to make that attack.

You can change a spell&apos;s range from touch to short (range of 25 feet + 5 feet per two caster levels) if the spell targets only your companion.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Devotion to the Cult of the Dragon Below. (<strong>Eberron</strong>)
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The saving throw DC of any mind-affecting spell or power that or manifest is increased by +1. However, you take a -2 penalty on all Will saves.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If you abandon your faith in the Dragon Below, you lose the benefit of this feat.

        <p>Your attacks can damage your opponent&apos;s ability to think clearly.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Sneak attack +3d6.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your successful sneak attack imposes a -2 penalty on the target&apos;s Intelligence and Wisdom checks, as well as on any Intelligence- and Wisdom-based skill checks, for 10 rounds. If you use this feat a second time on a target before 10 rounds have elapsed, the effect of the first use expires.<br>Using this feat reduces your sneak attack damage by 2d6.

        <p>Your skill with manipulating hard, or force, energy allows you to add physical force to spells and powers instead of converting existing energy to force.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Harden Energy.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: For every 3 power points or 1 spell level expended, you may add 1 die of bonus force damage to any spell or psionic power that has an energy descriptor (maximum one-half the effect&apos;s normal base damage dice). If the target is entitled to a saving throw, it applies to this bonus damage as well. You cannot expend more power points than your current total, nor can you spend more spell levels than those you have remaining. You can use Concussive Blast on a spell altered by Harden Energy, but you do not need to do so.<br>The hard energy portion of the damage can affect incorporeal creatures, ignoring the standard miss chance. The remaining energy damage of the spell or power remains subject to the standard 50% miss chance with respect to an incorporeal target.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Unlike other metamagic and metapsionic feats, Concussive Blast may be applied to a spell or power more than once. Each application on a spell requires 3 power points (or multiples of 3 power points if multiple dice of damage are added). Each application on a psionic power requires spell level (or multiples of 1 spell level if multiple dice of damage are added).

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Small or smaller, Tumble 10 ranks, Underfoot Combat.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This feat allows you to perform any of the following three maneuvers.</p><p><em>Knee Striker</em>: To use this maneuver, you must first move into a square occupied by a foe at least two size categories larger than you. On the next round, the foe is automatically considered flat-footed against your attacks, and you gain a +4 bonus on any roll you make to confirm a critical hit.</p><p><em>Underfoot Defense</em>: To use this maneuver, you must first move into a square occupied by a foe at least two size categories larger than you. On any succeeding round in which you remain in the foe&apos;s square and fight defensively, use total defense, or use Combat Expertise (minimum -1 penalty on attack rolls), any melee or ranged attack made against you has a 5000 chance to strike the foe whose square you occupy instead. This chance does not apply to attacks made by the creature whose square you occupy.</p><p><em>Unsteady Footing</em>: To use this maneuver, you must first move into a square occupied by a foe at least two size categories larger than you. On the next round, you can use a standard action to attempt to trip your foe without provoking attacks of opportunity. If your touch attack to initiate the trip attack succeeds, you can attempt a Strength or Dexterity check (your choice) opposed by your foe&apos;s Strength or Dexterity check (as normal) to trip your foe. Your foe may not add any bonus on his Strength or Dexterity check to avoid the trip that he would gain from his size. If your trip check fails, your opponent may not attempt to trip you. If you have Improved Trip, you can follow a successful trip attempt with an immediate melee attack.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you take damage from an electricity effect, you may send a line of electricity arcing from your body at any single target within 30 feet. This bolt deals half the damage you just took; a Reflex save (DC 16 + your Cha modifier) halves this damage.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability score from your primary discipline is 15+ (Psychic Warriors, Strength 15+)
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: From now on, your powers and psionic combat modes have become integrated with your subconscious mind. You can also activate subpsionic items without taking damage.<br>Add a +1 to all saving throws of powers you manifest from Metacreativity, Clairsentience, and Telepathy disciplines. You get a +1 bonus on manifester level checks to overcome power resistance for powers from these disciplines.<br>The subconscious mind proves less than optimal for powers from the Psychometabolism, Psychoportation, and Psychokinesis disciplines. Your effective manifester level for powers you manifest from these disciplines is lessened by -1. (Subpsionic characters cannot manifest powers from these disciplines if they are 1st-level characters.) The reduced manifester level affects the power&apos;s range, duration, damage, and any other level-dependent variables the power might have, including nullify checks against you.<br>From now on any psionic item you create is a subpsionic item.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Knowledge of the subconscious mind has a price. When you acquire this feat, you must reduce one of your stats by 2 points. Restorative powers (such as true rejuvenation) do not reverse the stat loss.

        <p>You can channel holy power into your spell-like abilities.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any good alignment.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This feat adds the good descriptor to a spell-like ability. Furthermore, if the ability deals damage, half that damage (rounded down) results from divine power and can&apos;t be reduced by resistance or immunity to energy-based attacks. For example, if a consecrated lightning bolt from an avoral deals 31 points of damage, 16 points of that is electricity damage and the other 15 points is not. Thus, a non-good creature immune to electricity still takes 15 points of damage if it fails its Reflex save.<br>Each of your spell-like abilities can be consecrated three times per day, though this feat does not allow you to exceed your normal usage limit for any ability. Thus, if a tulani eladrin chooses to consecrate its chain lightning ability, it can use a consecrated chain lightning up to three times that day Thereafter, it could use its chain lightning ability again normally (since it can use chain lightning at will), or it could consecrate another of its spell-like abilities, such as meteor swarm.

        <p>You can channel holy power through a spell trigger item, such as a wand or staff.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Craft Wand or Craft Staff, ability to turn undead.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you use a spell trigger item, such as a wand or staff, you can use one of your turning attempts for the day to trigger the item. You still expend a charge from the wand or staff. The spell cast by the item is modified as though it had the Consecrate Spell feat applied to it.

        <p>You can imbue your spells with the raw energy of good.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any good alignment.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: A spell you modify with this feat gains the good descriptor. Furthermore, if the spell deals damage, half of the damage (rounded down) results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to be reduced by resistance or immunity to energy-based attacks. For example, a <em>consecrated fire storm</em> spell cast by a 16th-level cleric deals 16d6 points of damage, half of which is fire damage and half of which is sheer divine power. Thus, creatures immune to fire still take damage. The consecrated spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Rather than a living creature, your familiar is a magical construct, a mechanical creature animated by magic. The arcane spellcaster must still specify a specific animal to call as a familiar; the familiar that appears, however, is a construct version of that creature.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Exposure to <em>fireball</em> or <em>delayed blast fireball</em> spell.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: If you catch on fire, you take no damage from the flames. A creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon takes 1d6 points of fire damage. The fire persists on your body for 1d4 rounds.<br>This feat doesn&apos;t protect you from other sources of fire damage, whether magical or not, only from the effects of catching on fire.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you return from death as a ghost, you look like a semitransparent version of your body at the peak of health. As a supernatural ability, you may change your ghostly clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment as a standard action as if using the <em>alter self</em> spell, but cannot change the actual appearance of your ghost body. Thus, you could appear to wear a traveler&apos;s outfit, a cold weather outfit, or even a royal outfit.<br>You do not receive any of the penalties or bonuses Charisma-based skill checks that a corpselike ghost could take because of the means of its death. You gain +1 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Gather Information, Intimidate, and Perform checks, and Charisma checks made to alter an NPC&apos;s attitude.

        <p>You can cast spells to greater effect in conjunction with the same spell cast by another individual.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any metamagic feat.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: While the two of you are adjacent, you and another spellcaster with the Cooperative Spell feat can simultaneously cast the same spell at the same time in the round. Add +2 to the save DC of cooperatively cast spells and +1 to caster level checks to beat the target&apos;s spell resistance (if any), using the higher base DC and level check of either caster. A cooperative spell uses up a spell slot of the same level as the spell&apos;s actual level.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: For each additional caster with this feat casting the same cooperative spell simultaneously, the spell&apos;s save DC and the bonus on the caster level check both increase by 1. When more than two spellcasters cooperatively cast a spell, each must be adjacent to at least two other casters involved in the casting. For example, two wizards and two sorcerers standing in a circle all have Cooperative Spell. The first three in the initiative order ready an action to cast <em>fireball</em>, casting the spell when the fourth does. The base DC of the spell&apos;s save is equal to the highest save DC among the cooperative casters (as determined by relevant ability scores, other feats, special abilities, or items) +4 (+2 for the first cooperative caster and +1 for each of the other two). As well, whoever has the highest caster level determines the base caster level check, which gains a +3 bonus (+1 for each cooperative caster).

        <p>You can possess and animate dead bodies.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ghost Ride
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As Ghost Ride, except that you may possess a relatively intact corpse (sufficient to make a zombie). You may not possess corporeal undead with this ability. You use the corpse&apos;s physical ability scores, modified as follows: Str -2, Dex -4, Con (the corpse has no Constitution score). The corpse does not get a saving throw to resist your possession attempt unless it is being held by another creature. You are still subject to the time limit of the Ghost Ride feat.<br>Possessing a corpse allows you to use its natural abilities, but not any other abilities it had in life that required special knowledge or skill, including feats, skills, spells, or extraordinary, spell-like, or supernatural abilities. The body gains no benefit from any of its character levels (so possessing a human corpse results in a body with 1 Hit Die). It has hit points equal to the average for a creature of its type, not including any Constitution bonus it may have had when alive.<br>You give the body a semblance of life, but it is not truly alive and continues to decay at a normal rate. The body is not undead and does not use undead Hit Dice.

        <p>You can prepare and cast corrupt spells.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spontaneous arcane or divine caster, mild depravity.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: If you have access to a corrupt spell in written form - on a scroll, in a spellbook, or in a tome of forbidden lore - you can prepare it in the same way that a wizard or cleric would. The prepared corrupt spell remains in your mind and occupies one of your daily spell slots until you cast it or change it. A prepared corrupt spell uses a spell slot of the spell&apos;s normal level, and you must pay corruption costs as normal for casting the spell.<br>Any corrupt spells you prepare by using this feat do not count against your total spells known, just your spells per day.

        <p>You have dabbled in strange magic that has increased your power but adversely affected your mind.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Sorcerer or wizard level 3rd, non-good alignment.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Add a +1 bonus to the DC for all sorcerer and wizard spells you cast. You get a +1 bonus on all caster level checks to overcome spell resistance with your sorcerer and wizard spells.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Your magical research has taken its toll on your mind. When you acquire this feat, your Wisdom score is immediately reduced by 2 points. Restorative spells (such as <em>restoration</em> or <em>greater restoration</em>) do not reverse this Wisdom loss.<br>Part of the damage to your mind has resulted in behavioral changes. You develop a fixation for dressing in black and gray clothing. If at least three-fourths of what you are clothed in is not black or gray, you lose the bonus to your DCs, but still suffer the reduction in Wisdom.<br>You are often plagued by horrible nightmares. Every night, you must succeed on a Wisdom check (DC 10 + 1 per day since the last bout of nightmares) to stave off these dark visions. If you fail this check, you are unable to prepare arcane spells for 24 hours.

        <h1>Corrupt Spell-like Ability</h1>

        <p>One of the creature&apos;s spell-like abilities is powered by evil. A dark pact provides the creature with unholy energy.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any evil alignment
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This feat adds the evil descriptor to a spell-like ability. Furthermore, if the spell-like ability deals damage, half of that damage (rounded down) is unholy damage. For example, if a corrupted fireball from a pit fiend deals a total of 35 points of damage, half of that amount (18 points) is fire damage and the other half (17 points) is unholy damage. Non-evil creatures immune to fire still take the 17 points of unholy damage.<br>Each of a creature&apos;s spell-like abilities can be corrupted three times per day, though the feat does not allow the creature to exceed its normal usage limit for any ability. Thus, if a pit fiend chooses to corrupt its fireball ability, it can use a corrupted fireball up to three times that day. Thereafter, it could use its fireball ability again normally (since it can use fireball at will), or it could corrupt another of its spell-like abilities, such as meteor swarm.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to each of its spell-like abilities three additional times per day

        <p>You can transform one of your spells into a thing of evil due to a deal you make with an evil power.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any evil alignment.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This feat adds the evil descriptor to one damaging spell you can cast. You must choose the spell at the time you select the feat. If the spell deals damage, half of the damage is unholy damage. For example, a corrupted fireball cast by a 6th-level wizard deals 6d6 points of damage: 3d6 points of fire damage and 3d6 points of unholy damage. Thus, creatures immune to fire still potentially take 3d6 points of damage.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A character can take this feat multiple times, choosing a different spell each time.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any non-good alignment.

        <p>You have learned to use the necromantic energy that powers your undead form to overcome the inability of undead creatures to wild shape. You can assume the form of an undead, rotten creature with the use of your wild shape ability.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Undead type, wild shape class feature.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can use your wild shape ability even though you are undead. The ability functions just as if you were a living creature using the ability, with the following exceptions.<br>You do not gain a Constitution score in the new form, and you retain all the immunities of the undead type while in your new form. The form you assume looks half-decayed, with missing patches of fur and rotted, worm-eaten flesh. While you are in this form, the rank odor of death hangs around you.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Since it is based on the <em>polymorph</em> spell, wild shape works only on living creatures.

        <p>Your touch can damage creatures.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can make a touch attack that deals 1d4 points of damage to a creature. When you are manifested fully or attacking incorporeal opponents, you add your Strength modifier to attack rolls. When you are incorporeal, you add your Dexterity modifier to attack rolls. If the attack scores a critical hit, the damage is doubled (ghosts are not subject to critical hits).<br>You do not have to use this ability when you touch another creature, and creatures that touch you do not take this damage.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: A ghost&apos;s touch attack normally deals no damage.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can alter your appearance in subtle ways. First and foremost, you can rid yourself of dust, dirt, sweat, and grime using a full round of concentration whenever you wish. Like-wise, you can dry yourself, style (and color) your hair, shave or trim (or color) your facial or body hair. These are all also full-round actions.<br>If desired, you can adopt a single cosmetic affectation, such as curiously shaped or colored eyes, hair that waves in an otherwise unfelt breeze, a strangely-shaped shadow, and so forth. This affectation is permanent once chosen, cannot be changed, and has no game effect.<br>Lastly, you can designate a single non-magical container no larger than 3 feet by 3 feet by 3 feet, into which you must place nothing but nonmagical apparel or jewelry. By concentrating for a round, you can conjure any article in the container and have it appear on your body, instantly wearing it. If you so desire, the clothing you wear in that same position can be transferred back to the container at the same time. Thus, you can change your clothing and your jewelry when you wish. You can conjure a warm cloak for a chill evening, or simply dress appropriately for dinner at a moment&apos;s notice. In no way does this enable you to conjure weapons or gear.

        <p>An aboleth with this feat can create magic glyphs that store spells or have specialized effects of their own.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Aboleth, caster level 5th.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The creature can create a permanent glyph of warding effect that automatically recharges and replenishes its own energy after a short period of inactivity after it is triggered Crafting an aboleth glyph takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of an aboleth glyph is its caster level x spell level x 1,000 gp. To create the glyph, the creature must spend 1/25 of the base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of the base price.<br>A newly created glyph functions exactly as if the creature had cast glyph of warding on the affected area, except that the glyph automatically reappears 1 minute after it is discharged. Similarly, if the glyph is dispelled, it reforms as good as new 1 minute later. An aboleth glyph can be destroyed only in the same manner that a magic item can be destroyed - <em>Mordenkainen&apos;s disjunction</em>, physical destruction of the glyph, and so on.<br>Alternatively, the aboleth can create a master glyph. Each master glyph is a unique glyph with specific effects and base costs; several sample master glyphs are detailed later in this chapter.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Craft (alchemy) 4 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain 100 craft points. You may use craft points to create alchemical items or substances, such as acid or tanglefoot bags.<br>You may spend your craft points to create alchemical items or substances at a rate of 1 craft point per 10 gp of market value of the finished item (minimum 1), even without spending the requisite creation time at work on the item.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If you take the requisite creation time at work on the item, you spend only 1 craft point per 50 gp of market value of the finished item (minimum 1).<br>This feat replaces the requirement of being a spellcaster in order to craft alchemical items as listed in the Craft skill in the Player&apos;s Handbook.

        <p>You can create psionic cognizance crystals that store power points.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Manifester level 3rd.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can create a cognizance crystal. Doing so takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a cognizance crystal is equal to the highest-level power it could manifest using all its stored power points, squared, multiplied by 1,000 gp. For example, a cognizance crystal that stores 5 power points could be used to manifest a power as high as 3rd level. Thus, its cost is 9,000 gp (3 x 3 x 1000 = 9,000). To create a cognizance crystal, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one half its base price.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Wondrous item.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: A creature with this feat can create any construct whose prerequisites it meets. Enchanting a construct takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its market price. To enchant a construct, a spellcaster must spend 1/25 the item&apos;s price in XP and use up raw materials costing half of this price (see the Golem, <a href="../../monsters/detail/Homunculus">Homunculus</a>, and <a href="../../monsters/detail/Shield_Guardian">Shield Guardian</a> monster entries for details).<br>
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A creature with this feat can repair constructs that have taken damage.

You must first create the weapon, using the rules for the Craft skill in the Player&apos;s Handbook (a Kuni crystal weapon adds 400 gp to the listed weapon price and has a DC of 20). Then you must enhance the weapon, which takes one day for each 1,000 gp in the price of its magical features.

        <p>You can create slender crystal wands called dorjes than manifest powers when charges are expended.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Manifester level 5th.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can create a dorje of any psionic power you know (barring exceptions, such as bestow power, as noted in a power&apos;s description). Crafting a dorje takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a dorje is its manifester level x the power level X 750 gp. To craft a dorje, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.<br>A newly created dorje has 50 charges.<br>Any dorje that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the XP cost derived from the base price, you must pay fifty times the XP cost.

        <h1>Craft Drilbu</h1>

            <br><strong>Source:</strong>  Web<br></p>
        <p>You can create a drilbu, which is a long shaft of crystal that can manifest powers when charges are expended.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Manifester level 5th+
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can create a drilbu, which is an enhanced version of a dorje, of any psionic power of 9th-level and lower that you know (or can channel, if you&apos;re crystalsinger). The character needs a supply of raw materials, with the most obvious being the drilbu or pieces of the drilbu to be assembled. The crafter must pay 1/25 of the base price in XP and use up raw materials costing half of the base price. To get the final price, the results can be modified by up to 20% based on the number and types of powers placed together in the same drilbu. Drilbus are always fully charged (fifty charges) when created. The base cost is as follows:<br>Total levels of powers x 750 gp x manifester level = base cost<br>If desired, a power can be placed into the drilbu at half the normal cost and power limitations, but activating that particular power costs 2 charges from the drilbu. For example, the crafter decides to add <em>plane shift</em>, a 7th-level power, to her drilbu, and she decides to halve the cost. The <em>plane shift</em> now requires 2 charges to activate, but it counts only as 3.5 power levels (round down) for determining cost and power limitations. A single power can cost no more than 2 charges, and the manifester level for all powers must be the same.<br>A drilbu is limited to 18 total power levels and can hold up to six powers; all powers must come from the same discipline.<br>The crafter must know the powers to be placed into the drilbu or must have the channeling ability to use the power from another psion. If manifesting the power would reduce the crafter&apos;s XP total, she pays the cost (times fifty) upon beginning the drilbu in addition to the XP cost for making the drilbu itself. This additional XP cost is paid by the psion manifesting the power if the power is a channeled one. The powers to be placed in the drilbu must be manifested each day while creating the drilbu. This does not incur the additional XP cost; it just requires the expenditure of the power points.<br>Crafting a drilbu requires one day for each 1,000 gp value of the completed drilbu.

        <p>You know the ancient Netherese secret of creating magic scepters - devices that can contain much more powerful spells than a magic wand can.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Knowledge (history) 4 ranks, caster level 9th.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can create a scepter that holds any spell of 7th level or lower that you know. Unlike a magic wand, a scepter can contain up to two spells, each of which has a cost in charges to use. Both spell effects draw from a common pool of charges, so they can be used in any combination.<br>Crafting a scepter takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a scepter is its caster level x the spell level x 750 gp for the highest-level spell included, plus the caster level x the spell level x 375 gp for the second spell, if any. To craft a scepter, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this amount. A newly created scepter has 50 charges. Any scepter that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the cost derived from the base price, you must expend fifty units of the material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.<br>See page 153, Ancient Empires of Faer&#xFB;n, for more information on scepters.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can create a skull talisman of any spell you know and that targets one or more creatures. Crafting a skull talisman takes one day. When you create a skull talisman, you set the caster level. The caster level must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a skull talisman is its spell level x its caster level x 100 gp. To craft the talisman, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials (mostly comprised of the rare metallic inks needed to inscribe the runes of power on the skull) costing one-half this base price.<br>When you create a skull talisman, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever destroys the skull is the target of the spell.<br>Any skull talisman that stores a spell with a costly material component or a XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when creating the skull talisman.<br>The skull to be used to create a skull talisman must be from a creature of at least Small size. A Small creature&apos;s skull can store a spell of up to 3rd level. A Medium creature&apos;s skull can store a spell of up to 6th level. A large creature&apos;s skull can store a spell of up to 9th level. The art of crafting skull talismans was perfected by neanderthal druids, but any spellcaster can learn the art of making these devices. Many view the act of creating or using a skull talisman as a distasteful activity, but neither in and of itself is it an evil act.

A newly created wand has 50 charges. Any wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the cost derived from the base cost, you must expend fifty copies of the material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.

        <p>You can create a portal that has a moving origin point.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Create Portal
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: By creating this type of portal, you affix a portal to the frame rather than to a fixed point in space. A moving portal requires that the origin be anchored to some material frame, such as an arch on a wagon or the limbs of a tree. Beings using the portal must be able to pass through the frame. For example, you could create a portal that exists inside a treant&apos;s branches, and the portal would move with the treant. You could not affix a portal to an ogre or gray ooze and have the portal follow the creature around. You cannot create portals that move on their own power or that move by magical means. All movement of the portal is directed by the frame to which the portal is affixed. It is not possible to move a portal&apos;s frame through itself. Adding this feature to your portal increases the base cost of the portal by +25%.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Portals created without the feat are fixed in space.

        <p>A creature with this feat can create psionic glyphs or symbols that hold spells or psionic powers until triggered.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Int 15, psionic ability (spell-like abilities described as psionics, psi-like abilities, or psionic powers), caster level or manifester level 7th.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: A creature can cast or manifest any arcane spell or psionic power it has access to as a psionic seal. If it is creating a psionic seal of an arcane spell, it must have prepared the spell to be scribed and must provide any material components or focuses the spell requires. If casting the spell or manifesting the power would reduce the creature&apos;s XP total, it pays that cost upon beginning the seal in addition to the XP cost for making the seal itself. Likewise, material components are consumed when the creature begins scribing the seal, but focuses are not.<br>A single object of Medium size or smaller can hold only one psionic seal. A larger object can hold one seal per 100 square feet of surface area. A creature can also scribe a psionic seal on a willing creature, but a creature can hold only one psionic seal at a time; any additional seals inscribed on that creature automatically fail.<br>A psionic seal has a price equal to its spell or power level x caster or manifester level x 50 gp. (A 0-level spell or power counts as 1/2 level.) The creature crafting the seal must spend 1/25 of the price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half the price to inscribe the seal.

You have learned to channel energy into a foe&apos;s spell to weaken its effects. Although you fail to nullify the spell, you render it much easier to resist.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Improved Counterspell.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can use an immediate action to attempt to dampen an enemy&apos;s spell. As with counterspelling, you must identify the target spell as it is being cast.

Because of your hasty, immediate casting, you do not fully counter the target spell. Instead, you subtract the level of the spell or spell slot you expend from the save DC of your opponent&apos;s spell.

The four basic uses are detailed below.<br><em>Dread</em>: Whenever you use Dark Speech in this manner, you take 1d4 points of Charisma damage, and every other creature in a 30-foot radius must attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier). The result of a failed save by a listener depends on the listener&apos;s character level and alignment, as detailed on the table below. </p><table class="table" style="width:30em"><tr><td><strong>Level (Alignment)</strong></td><td><strong>Result</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1st-4th (non-evil)</td><td>Listener is shaken for 1d10 rounds and must flee from you until you are out of sight.</td></tr><tr><td>1st-4th (evil)</td><td>Listener cowers in fear for 1d10 rounds.</td></tr><tr><td>5th-10th (non-evil)</td><td>Listener is shaken for 1d10 rounds.</td></tr><tr><td>5th-10th (evil)</td><td>Listener is charmed by you (as <em>charm monster</em>) for 1d10 rounds.</td></tr><tr><td>11th+ (non-evil)</td><td>Listener is filled with loathing for you but is not otherwise influenced.</td></tr><tr><td>11th+ (evil)</td><td>Listener is impressed, and you gain a +2 competence bonus on attempts to change his attitude in the future.</td></tr></table><p><em>Power</em>: Whenever you use Dark Speech in this manner, you take 1d4 points of Charisma damage. By incorporating the Dark Speech into the verbal component of a spell, you increase its effective caster level by 1. By using it during the creation of an evil magic item, you increase its caster level by 1 without increasing the cost.<br><em>Corruption</em>: As a full-round action, you can whisper vile words at an inanimate object and reduce its hardness by half. This use does not drain you, but you cannot use the ability more than once on a single object.<br><em>Dark Unity</em>: You can use Dark Speech to establish a hive mind in any swarm of vermin or animals with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower. Thereafter, you can give the swarm one command as per the suggestion spell (caster level equals your Hit Dice). Whenever you infuse a swarm in this manner, you take 1d4 points of Constitution damage.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws made when someone uses the Dark Speech against you.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Attempting to utter a word of Dark Speech always ends in immediate death for a speaker who is not trained in its dark power. It is impossible to make someone use the Dark Speech if he is unwilling because the language&apos;s pronunciation is so exacting.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You must succeed with a melee touch attack to use this feat. Until just before your next turn, all creatures adjacent to the target other than yourself are considered to be flanking the target. This is an extraordinary mind-affecting effect.

        <p>You can cast spells that seem to come from somewhere other than where they should.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: A deceptive spell appears to come from any direction you choose. For instance, a <em>magic missile</em> might shoot from a nearby doorway, rather than from your own finger, or a <em>lightning bolt</em> might emerge from the floor rather than from you. You cannot use this feat to gain a bonus to hit, to circumvent cover, to flank, or in any other way to gain a numeric or mechanical advantage on any attack rolls. Its purpose is to disguise the source of the spell, preventing anyone who did not actively observe you casting it from recognizing you as its caster. You cannot apply Deceptive Spell to any spell with a range of touch or a target of you. A deceptive spell uses up a slot one level higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

        <p>You can power your spells using energy stolen from plants around you.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast 1st-level arcane spells.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You may draw the life force of plants around you in an act known as defiling. Casting a spell with defiling magic increases the caster level of the spell by +1. A spell cast with defiling magic takes longer to cast. If the spell&apos;s casting time is a standard action or less, its casting time increases to 1 round. If the spell&apos;s casting time is measured in rounds, its casting time increases by 1 round. If the spell&apos;s casting time is measured in minutes, its casting time increases by 1 minute. If the spell&apos;s casting time is measured in hours, its casting time increases by 1 hour.<br>You may only use defiling magic to enhance arcane spells cast with an arcane spellcasting class. You cannot, for example, use defiling magic to cast a cleric&apos;s domain spell that also appears on an arcane spellcasting class&apos;s spell list.<br>When you defile, you instantly destroy all plant life (but not plant creatures) in a radius of 5 feet per level of the spell. A 0-level spell defiles a single 1-foot square. The defiled area becomes completely sterile and can never again support plant life. Only a carefully worded <em>miracle</em> can reverse this permanent sterility.<br>In an area without plant life (such as an area in which you already used defiler magic once before), any spell you cast with defiling magic fails and you lose the spell.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You cannot cast arcane spells on Athas unless you possess this feat, even if you intend on never defiling. Wizards native to Athas gain this feat as a bonus feat when they gain their first level of wizard.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Dex 13, Improved Unarmed Strike.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with a ranged weapon, you may deflect it so that you take no damage from it. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn&apos;t count as an action. Unusually massive ranged weapons, such as boulders hurled by giants, and ranged attacks generated by spell effects, such as <em>Melf&apos;s acid arrow</em>, can&apos;t be deflected.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A monk may select Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat at 2nd level, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.<br>A fighter may select Deflect Arrows as one of his fighter bonus feats.

You can manifest a power as a delayed power. A delayed power doesn&apos;t activate immediately. When you manifest the power, you choose one of three trigger mechanisms: (1) The power activates when you activate it; (2) It activates when a creature enters the area that the power will affect (only powers that affect areas can use this trigger condition); or (3) It activates on your turn after 5 rounds pass. If you choose one of the first two triggers and the conditions are not met within 5 rounds, the power activates automatically on the fifth round.<br>Only area and personal powers can be delayed.<br>Any decisions you would make about the delayed power, including attack rolls, designating targets, or determining or shaping an area, are decided when the power is manifested. Any effects resolved by those affected by the power, including saving throws, are decided when the delay period ends.<br>A delayed power can be dispelled normally during the delay, and can be detected normally in the area or on the target by the use of powers that can detect psionic effects.<br>Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any metamagic feat.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When casting a spell, you set a delay of 1 to 5 rounds before it takes effect. The delay time cannot be changed once set; the spell activates just before your turn on the round you designate. Only area, personal, and touch spells can be affected by this feat. Any decisions you would make about the spell (including attack rolls, designating targets, or determining or shaping an area) are decided when the spell is cast, with any of its effects (including damage and saving throws) decided when the spell triggers. If conditions change during the delay period in ways that would make the spell impossible to cast (the target you designate moves beyond the spell&apos;s range, for example), the spell fails. During the delay period, a delayed spell can be dispelled normally, and it can be detected in the area or on the target (as applicable).<br>A delayed spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As an immediate action on a foe&apos;s turn, you can designate one of your allies as someone your foe cannot target with spells or spell-like abilities until the end of his turn. This only affects the foe&apos;s ability to target spells or spell-like abilities for the rest the round. This does not protect your ally from area effects.

        <p>By warping its truename, you can make your foe easier to harm.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: <a href="../../charbuild/skills/truespeak.shtml">Truespeak</a> 12 ranks, any recitation feat, ability to speak utterances, must know your own personal truename.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You lower a creature&apos;s damage reduction by 5 for 3 rounds when you succeed on a Truespeak check to say its personal truename. The Truespeak DC to use this denouncement is 10 higher than normal.<br>This feat does not grant you knowledge of a creature&apos;s damage reduction. It has no effect on creatures immune to a type of damage. The reduction caused by this feat stacks with itself. You may, for example, reduce a creature&apos;s damage reduction by 5 one round and an additional 5 the following round. Using the ability in this way does not change the duration, so the first reduction you create ends 1 round before the next. You may also choose to reduce multiple forms of damage reduction from the same creature, with each reduction having its own duration.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Character level 3rd.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The minimum key ability score for manifesting a power is reduced by 2 for all of your nonprimary disciplines. This feat does not grant the ability to manifest a non-discipline power of a higher level than the highest-level primary discipline power you can manifest. For example, when manifesting a power, the required key ability score is normally 10 plus the power&apos;s level; this feat would reduce that to 8 plus the power&apos;s level. A psionic character without a primary discipline treats his highest ability score (when this feat is chosen) as his primary ability for purposes of this feat.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You may take this feat multiple times. Each time you take this feat beyond the first reduces the minimum key ability score required for manifesting a power by 2 for all of your non-primary disciplines. If a score is reduced to zero through temporary or permanent ability score loss, this feat ceases functioning for that ability and for any discipline associated with that ability score.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Constitution 13.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You are immune to one specific type of disease, such as the red ache or mummy rot. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against other diseases (including magical diseases). You recover points lost to ability damage from disease at double the normal rate (2 points per day, rather than i). If someone with the Heal skill (including yourself) uses your blood to help someone with the disease to which you are immune, the diseased character automatically makes his saving throw to recover.

All creatures that come into contact with this aura must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + your Charisma bonus + your total number of racial feats) or become sickened for a number of rounds equal to your total number of racial feats.

Unless the spell visibly emanates from you, or observers have some other means of determining its source, they don&apos;t know where the effect came from.<br>A disguised spell can&apos;t be identified with a Spellcraft check, even by someone who realizes you&apos;re casting a spell.

        <p>A creature with this feat can use disintegrate effects to affect smaller, more exacting areas.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Dex 13, ability to cast <em>disintegrate</em> as a spell or use it as a spell-like or supernatural ability.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When the creature uses disintegrate on a target, it can elect to disintegrate only portions of the target. Against living targets, it still does the normal amount of damage, but any parts of the target it wishes to spare remain unaffected by the spell. The creature could, for example, disintegrate only a target&apos;s skeleton, leaving its skull untouched. It also can voluntarily reduce the amount of damage dealt.<br>Against nonliving targets, the creature can use disintegrate to sculpt and reshape the object in any manner desired, as long as the result is no larger in volume or size than the original object. The quality of the result is determined by a Craft (sculpting) check.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If your campaign uses the Damage to Specific Areas variant rule on page 27 of the Dungeon Master&apos;s Guide, a creature with this feat can disintegrate a single part of a target&apos;s body, such as its hand, arm, head, eyes, ears, feet, legs, and so on, as long as the target is not killed outright by the damage caused by the spell.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: A disintegrate effect destroys all of a slain creature, an entire object, or one 10-foot cube of nonliving matter.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Cha 19, Focused Antimagic, beholder with functional antimagic ability.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a standard action, the creature can reduce the cone-shaped area of effect of its central eye&apos;s antimagic cone down to a razor-thin eye ray. If the creature hits a magical effect or magic item with this narrowed eye ray, it disjoins the effect or item as if it had cast <em>Mordenkainen&apos;s disjunction</em> on the effect or item.<br>Beholders avoid using this narrowed ray on magic items since the destruction of a magic item also destroys a potential source of magic that could be used to charge their dweomerlobes.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Devotion to the Cult of the Dragon Below. (<strong>Eberron</strong>)
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you apply a metamagic feat to a spontaneous spell, you may take Wisdom damage instead of increasing the level of the spell slot level of the spell. You take 1 point of Wisdom damage for each spell slot level. For example, using Silent Spell would cause you to take 1 point of Wisdom damage. You may only use this to offset the increased spell slot level of a single feat per casting, and you cannot cast a spell if the increased spell slot level would place it above your ability to cast - for example, a 6th-level sorcerer cannot cast a <em>silent fireball</em> through the use of this feat. Wisdom damage dealt by this feat can only be healed naturally at the rate of 1 per day. Magical healing has no effect. You cannot use this feat if the damage would lower your Wisdom below 1.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If you abandon your faith in the Dragon Below, you lose the benefits of this feat.

        <p>You are descended from a dragon. The dragon bloodline is strong in both physical power and magic. Your characteristics might vary with the type of dragon from which you are descended, but you share some traits with others of draconic blood. Like your majestic reptilian ancestor, you are proud and of noble bearing, and you might even share its coloration in some way. Although characters with draconic blood can have any alignment, they are prone to mimic their dragon ancestor&apos;s personalities. Others often see them as somewhat arrogant and obsessive, but the dragon-blooded usually feel justifiably proud of their abilities. Spellcasters with draconic ancestors love knowledge and beautiful items, and they often adventure to acquire one or the other. Their spell selections tend toward either flamboyant, combat-oriented spells, or knowledge-gathering spells. Sorcerers of this bloodline favor the same environments as their dragon ancestors.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your ancestry gives you a bonus spell known at each spell level, starting at 1st, according to the following list.</p><ul><li>1. Comprehend languages</li><li>2. Darkvision</li><li>3. Protection from elements</li><li>4. Fear</li><li>5. Mind fog</li><li>6. True seeing</li><li>7. Vision</li><li>8. Mind blank</li><li>9. Dominate monster</li></ul><p>
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If a character takes this feat any time after 1st level and has already learned any of the spells on this list in the class that granted him access to this feat, he gains no additional spells known at those spell levels. This restriction does not apply if he learned any of these spells as a member of another spellcasting class. A character with the Draconic Bloodline feat retains many of the strengths and weaknesses of his ancestor. As such, he must choose a category of spells (often spells with a certain descriptor) that he cannot learn or cast. (For example, the descendant of a green dragon might not be able to cast spells with the earth descriptor, while the heir of a bronze dragon might be denied access to spells with the fire descriptor.) Such spells do not appear on the character&apos;s spell list for any class. The DM should be involved in the decision about which category of spells the character is denied.

        <p>You can use your Knowledge (the planes) skill to interpret your dreams or the dreams of others, thus gleaning useful information and insights.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can interpret the basic symbolism of a dream to figure out what sorts of concerns or fears are likely to have inspired it. </p><table class="table" style="width:30em"><tr><td><strong>Dream Being Interpreted</strong></td><td><strong>Knowledge (the planes) DC</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Features obvious symbolism</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Involves cultural details or concepts with which you are not very familiar</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Represents memories of past events with which you are not familiar</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Both the previous conditions are true</td><td>25</td></tr></table><p>Attempting to garner insight into future events, or events occurring elsewhere, by reading the prophetic images of a dream adds +10 to +20 to the base DC, depending on how obscure the omens are.<br>The DM must decide if a dream contains prophetic imagery; a sufficiently high roll might glean some information even if the dream was not overtly oracular. Making the DC required to interpret a dream grants information comparable to an <em>augury</em> spell. Exceeding the required check by 10 or more offers information comparable to a <em>divination</em> spell. Exceeding the required check by 20 or more offers information comparable to a <em>commune</em> spell.<br>Even if your result was not high enough to enable you to read prophetic images, the result might be sufficient to interpret basic symbols and events. Thus, a check result of 18 is insufficient to foretell the future but still grants some information about cultural details or concepts.<br>You can use this feat to determine what effect injuries received in a dreamscape are likely to have on you once you return (DC 15), or whether an item or location was created by the dreamer or brought in from outside (DC 20); see Chapter 3, <strong>Heroes of Horror</strong> for information on adventuring within dreamscapes.<br>Finally, this feat allows Knowledge (the planes) to function in place of Survival when used within a dreamscape. This skill can be used to retrace your steps and return to a known person&apos;s dream, or to attempt to track a creature across the dreamscape.<br><strong>Action</strong>: Dreamtelling requires careful analysis of bizarre images and events. If you are trying to interpret your own dream, you must cogitate on it for a number of minutes equal to 30 minus your Intelligence modifier. If you wish to analyze someone else&apos;s dream, that person must first describe it to you in great detail, adding an additional 10+1d10 minutes to the process.<br><strong>Try Again</strong>: No. The check represents your ability to interpret that particular dream. You can attempt to interpret other dreams the same individual has later, but you get only one attempt per dream. Similarly, you have only one attempt to determine whether an item is native to a particular dream.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Most campaigns are not set up to interact with the dream world. Hence, this feat is only available if the DM specifically states that he or she has decided to allow it in his or her campaign.

The opaque wall&apos;s near endpoint begins at any corner of your space and extends in a straight line 10 feet long (or as long as space permits, if the area is smaller). The wall lasts for 1d4 rounds.<br>Any creature passing through the wall takes damage equal to the damage your energy ray psi-like ability would normally deal. if you create a wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Either way, a successful Reflex save halves this damage (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Con modifier).

            <br><strong>Sources:</strong>  Dragon #311<br> Dragon Compendium Vol. 1<br></p>
        <p>You are descended from a creature of elemental earth. Your heritage probably stems from one of the humanoid-shaped beings from the Elemental Plane of Earth, although elemental earth creatures native to the Material Plane can contribute this bloodline as well. Regardless of the exact earth creature in your ancestry, you probably have a hardy, solid-looking body and dark coloration, and you might even exude an earthy smell.<br>Stone giants produce long, lean descendants who tend to be shy but playful. The progeny of earth mephits are generally stubborn, while those of salt mephits are often gifted with a sarcastic wit. Characters with gargoyle blood tend to be territorial and prone to violence, especially when it comes to protecting what is theirs. Some would say that sorcerers with the Earth Bloodline feat are unchanging, but this assessment is not entirely true. Rather, they are slow to change - not to mention tough, determined, and unwavering in their goals. They generally enjoy being underground, so they like to delve into dungeons and other subterranean locales.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your ancestry gives you a bonus spell known at each spell level, starting at 1st, according to the following list.</p><ul><li>1. Enlarge person</li><li>2. Shatter</li><li>3. Keen edge</li><li>4. Stone shape</li><li>5. Transmute mud to rock</li><li>6. Move earth</li><li>7. Statue</li><li>8. Iron body</li><li>9. Summon monster IX (elementals and outsiders with the earth subtype only)</li></ul><p>
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If a character takes this feat any time after 1st level and has already learned any of the spells on this list in the class that granted her access to this feat, she gains no additional spells known at those spell levels. This restriction does not apply if she learned any of these spells as a member of another spellcasting class. Characters with this feat cannot learn or cast spells with the air descriptor, and all such spells are removed from the spell lists of all their spellcasting classes.

This ability also grants you a +5 sacred (if your deity is good or neutral) or profane (if your deity is evil) bonus on Balance, Climb, and Jump checks.<br>If you use this ability to affect nearby terrain, you can change one 5-foot square of earth or stone from normal to difficult terrain for every three character levels you possess (minimum 1 square; maximum 6 squares at 18th level). The first square you change must be within 30 feet of you, and all other squares must be linked to that one in an unbroken line. Thus, the second square must be adjacent to the first, the third must be adjacent to the first or second, and so on. This change lasts for 1 minute.<br>On attaining 10th level, you can cause stone spikes to grow from any surface you have changed to difficult terrain using this ability. These spikes work like caltrops, except that the bonus on attack rolls for each spike equals your base attack bonus, and they cannot be swept away. This effect also lasts 1 minute. If you cause spikes to appear underneath a creature on the affected surface, they immediately &quot;attack.&quot;
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each daily turn or rebuke use you expend.

You gain an additional +2 dodge bonus to AC when fighting defensively or using the total defense action.<br><em>Off-Hand Balance</em>: You use your off hand to balance yourself while performing acrobatic maneuvers. After you successfully strike an opponent, you gain a +2 bonus on Tumble checks to avoid his attacks of opportunity until the start of your next turn.

When you use this maneuver, you must first take a full attack action to strike an opponent at least twice. On your next turn, you can make a special feint as a free action, using Sleight of Hand rather than Bluff. Your opponent uses the standard rules for resisting a feint. Once you use this maneuver against a particular opponent, whether it succeeds or fails, you cannot use it against him again.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The Elusive Target feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers.<br><strong>Negate Power Attack</strong>: To use this maneuver, you must designate a specific foe robe affected by your Dodge feat.

The first attack of the round from the designated attacker automatically misses you and may strike the other flanking foe instead; the attacking creature makes an attack roll normally, and its ally is considered flat-footed. If the designated attacker is making a full attack against you, its second and subsequent attacks function normally.<br><strong>Cause Overreach</strong>: To use this maneuver, you must provoke an attack of opportunity from a foe by moving our of a threatened square. If the foe misses you, you can make a free trip attempt against this foe, and the foe does not get a chance to trip you if your attempt fails.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell-like ability are increased by one-half. An empowered spell-like ability deals half again as much damage as normal, cures half again as many hit points, affects half again as many targets, and so on as appropriate.

Spell-like abilities without random variables are not affected.<br>Each of a creature&apos;s spell-like abilities can be empowered twice per day, though the feat does not allow the creature to exceed its normal usage limit for any ability. Thus, if a night hag chooses to empower its magic missile ability, it can use an empowered magic missile up to two times that day.

Once the power has been manifested, the psicrystal is empty, and the psion can embed any other targeted psionic power of up to 3rd level. The psion must maintain at least 1 power point in reserve until the power is manifested. If he or she doesn&apos;t, the psicrystal loses the power.</li><li><strong>Greater Self-Propulsion</strong>: If the psion pays the cost of 3 power points, his or her psicrystal becomes encased in a tiny shell of ectoplasm (3-inch diameter), and it forms a whiplike tail (6 inches long) and the psion&apos;s choice of one of the following for a day: spidery legs, batlike wings, or fishlike fins. The legs grant the psicrystal a speed of 30 feet. The psicrystal can climb walls and ceilings with its legs like a spider at a speed of 20 feet. The wings grant the psicrystal the ability to fly at a speed of 30 feet (perfect). The fishlike fins grant the psicrystal the ability to swim at a speed of 20 feet. The whip like tail grants the psicrystal the ability to grasp fine objects and aids in its movement. The psicrystal cannot attack with its ectoplasmic appendages. Additionally, the ectoplasmic shell body grants the psicrystal a +5 armor bonus to AC. The ectoplasm fades to nothingness when the duration expires, or when the psicrystal takes 1 or more points of damage that penetrate its hardness, whichever occurs first.</li><li><strong>Energized Crystal</strong>: The psicrystal gains the ability to store power points as a crystal capacitor. The number of power points that it can store equals the Intelligence of the psicrystal rounded down to the nearest odd number. For example, a psicrystal with an Intelligence of 12 could store 11 power points.</li><li><strong>Discipline Focus</strong>: When the psicrystal is within 5 feet of the psion, any powers manifested that are of the psion&apos;s primary discipline cost 1 less power point to manifest. Powers manifested this way have a minimum of 1 power point.</li><li><strong>Psionatrix Essence</strong>: If the psion pays the cost of 3 power points, the psicrystal acts as a psionatrix appropriate to the psion&apos;s primary discipline for a day. The psion benefits from these effects only when within 5 feet of the psicrystal. (see psionatrices on page 133 of the <em>Psionics Handbook</em>)</li><li><strong>Phasing</strong>: If the psion pays the cost of 3 power points, the psicrystal can move through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through other materials, for a day. The psicrystal can pass through a total of 60 feet, though it can break this distance up into several smaller passages or one long one, as desired. (For example, the psicrystal could pass through a 10-foot-thick wall, then a 20-foot- thick wall, and then a 30-foot-thick wall.) A psicrystal that exceeds this daily allotment midway through a wall is ejected from the material at the point of entry. (For example, if the psicrystal has already passed through 50 feet of material, then attempts to pass through a 20-foot thick barrier, it would be ejected once it reaches 10 feet.)</li></ul><p>

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose a spell that you are capable of casting and that is of a level no higher than one level below the highest-level spell you can cast.

For example, if Tordek (Con 15) is struck by a wight, he gains one negative level. However, he can ignore the -1 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks associated with that negative level for 2 minutes, since his Constitution bonus is +2.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Invest Armor
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can expend your psionic focus to infuse your armor with psychic energy. This gives you resistance 10 against the next attack or effect with an energy descriptor that affects you.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Non-evil alignment, must not have the ability to rebuke undead.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your spells are infused with positive energy. An energized spell deals an extra 50% damage to undead creatures, but deals 50% less damage to non-undead creatures and to objects. An energized spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

        <p>Casting an abjuration spell grants you protection from energy damage.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spell Focus (abjuration) or abjurer level 1st.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you cast an abjuration spell, you can choose to gain a special energy resistance equal to (1 + the spell&apos;s level) x 5. This energy resistance lasts for the duration of the abjuration spell you cast or until you are struck by any type of energy damage (acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic). The resistance applies to the first energy damage to which you are exposed, and thereafter you lose the energy resistance until you cast another abjuration spell.

        <p>You can modify a spell that uses one type of energy to add an equal amount of another energy type.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Energy Substitution.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, or fire) that matches an energy type you have selected for substitution via the Energy Substitution feat. You can then modify any spell with an energy descriptor by adding an equal amount of the chosen type of energy to the spell&apos;s normal effects. The altered spell works normally in all respects except for the type and amount of damage dealt, with each type of energy counting separately toward the spell&apos;s damage cap. Thus, an <em>acid fireball</em> cast at 6th level deals 6d6 points of fire damage and 6d6 points of acid damage (rolled separately), while the same <em>acid fireball</em> cast at 10th level or higher deals 10d6 points of fire damage and 10d6 points of acid damage. Even opposed types of energy (such as fire and cold) can be combined using this feat.<br>An energy admixed spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell&apos;s actual level. As well, the spell&apos;s descriptor changes to include both energy types present in the spell-for example, the <em>acid fireball</em> described above is an evocation &lt;acid, fire&gt; spell.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can gain this feat multiple times, choosing a different type of energy each time. The type of energy selected with this feat must match a type of energy you have also selected for substitution via the Energy Substitution feat (so you can select cold as your energy type with Energy Admixture if you have selected cold as your Energy Substitution energy type). You can use Energy Admixture to further alter a spell that has already been modified with Energy Substitution, and you can also admix your chosen energy type with a spell that already uses the same type, in effect doubling its normal damage dice.

        <p>You can modify a spell that uses one type of energy to use another type (acid, cold, electricity, or fire) instead.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks, able to cast at least one spell of each of these energy types: acid, cold, electricity, and fire.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You can modify any spell with an energy descriptor to use the chosen type of energy instead. A spell so modified works normally in all respects except the type of damage dealt.<br>A modified spell uses a spell slot of the spell&apos;s normal level, modified by any other metamagic feats.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any one of the following feats: Agitated Causticity, Astral Fire, Bioelectrical Surge, or Solid Freeze
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you take this feat, you choose an energy type that matches the energy type represented by the psi-spell feat that allowed you access to Energy Flare (acid for Agitated Causticity, fire for Astral Fire, and so on). This feat can be applied to any spell or power that has an energy descriptor matching this energy type.<br>You increase the damage die type of a spell or power with the appropriate energy descriptor by one step (d4 becomes d6, d6 becomes d8, and so on). The number of damage dice remains unchanged.<br>To apply Energy Flare to a spell, the caster must expend 4 power points per spell level. To apply it to a psionic power, the manifester must spend 2 spell levels per power level. The feat need not be used in combination with its prerequisite feat, although it can be.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: This feat can be taken more than once. Each time it is taken, it applies to a different energy descriptor and requires the corresponding prerequisite.

        <p>You have learned to combine multiple energy effects to great advantage.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spell Focus (evocation), caster level 3rd.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The Energy Gestalt feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers. In every case, you must deal damage to one or more subjects with a pair of energy-based spells you cast in 2 successive rounds.<br><em>Acrid Fumes</em>: You cast an acid spell followed by a fire spell. The flames of your second spell turn some of the lingering acid into choking, sickening fumes. Any living creature damaged by both spells is nauseated for 1 round. Those who make a successful Fortitude save (DC based on the second spell) are sickened for 1 round instead. Treat this as a poison effect for the purpose of save bonuses and immunities.<br><em>Brittle Blast</em>: You cast a cold spell followed by a sonic spell. Any object or construct damaged by both spells takes +50% damage from the sonic spell, because its physical structure has been made brittle by the cold.<br><em>Improved Conduction</em>: You cast a cold spell followed by an electricity spell. The lingering cold more effectively conducts the electricity, temporarily fatiguing creatures. Living creatures damaged by both spells are slowed for 1 round (as the <em>slow</em> spell). Creatures that make successful Fortitude saves (DC based on the second spell) are fatigued for 1 round.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Energy resistance class ability.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Each day you gain a pool of stored energy of one of the types of energy you have resistance against. The pool of stored energy equals 1d6 per two divine caster levels. As a standard action, you may unleash this energy in a 30-foot ray as a ranged touch attack that deals any number of dice of damage from 1d6 up to the number of dice remaining in your stored energy pool. You can use this ability at will as long as you have stored energy in your pool, but each ray must deal at least id6 points of damage.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Corrupting Touch, non-good alignment, Cha 15.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can make a touch attack that bestows one negative level upon a creature.

If the attack scores a critical hit, the number of negative levels is doubled (ghosts are not subject to critical hits). Bestowing negative levels does not heal you. Only one kind of damage or effect from the path of the corrupter applies from each attack. Negative levels remain until 24 hours have passed or until removed with a spell such as <em>restoration</em>. At that time, the afflicted opponent must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Cha modifier). On a success, the negative level goes away with no harm to the creature. On a failure, the negative level goes away, but the creature&apos;s level is also reduced by one. A separate saving throw is required for each negative level.<br>You do not have to use this ability when you touch another creature, and creatures that touch you do not gain negative levels. You may use this attack once per day per character level.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: A ghost&apos;s touch attack normally deals no damage.

        <p>When facing the aftermath of a wild surge, enervation doesn&apos;t sap your power points.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Psychic enervation class feature.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Repeated exposure to wild surges and their debilitating aftereffects has increased your resistance to psychic enervation. From now on, when you become enervated, you lose power points equal to one-half your wilder level, although you are still dazed until the end of your next turn.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: A wilder overcome by psychic enervation is dazed until the end of his next turn and loses a number of power points equal to his wilder level.

        <p>You can use the life energy of an opponent to heal yourself.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Fey&apos;ri, ability to use enervation as a spell-like ability
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you use your enervation ability, you may choose to touch an opponent instead of firing a ray, making a melee touch attack to do so. If the target gains negative levels, you heal 5 hit points for every negative level the target gains from this attack as if you had been healed with positive energy.

        <p>You can change the characteristics of a persistent spell effect that is already in place.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Knowledge (arcana) 30 ranks, Spellcraft 30 ranks, Skill Focus (Spellcraft) metamagic effect class ability.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can change any variables of a persistent spell effect that is already in place (except its point of origin or the spell&apos;s center of effect) as if you were casting the spell yourself, even if you can&apos;t normally cast that spell. For example, you can change the radius of a ring-shaped <em>wall of fire</em>, but you cannot change its point of origin.<br>You can substitute your own caster level for the spell&apos;s original caster level if you choose. You can also shape the effect as you desire within the parameters of the spell. As with the metamagic effect ability, you must be adjacent to or within the spell effect and make a Spellcraft check - in this case against a DC equal to 30 + (3 x the spell&apos;s level).<br>You can use this ability and your metamagic effect ability a total number of times per day equal to 5 + your Intelligence modifier. Like metamagic effect, using this ability is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

        <p>You can increase the minimum DC for saving throws of magic items you create.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any other item creation feats.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose any item creation feat you already know. When you create an item with that feat, adjust the DC for saving throws required by the magic item, if any, by your key ability modifier.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can gain this multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a different item creation feat that you already know.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: When a character creates a magic item, she uses the minimum key ability score necessary to imbed a spell of a given level, and the associated modifier to adjust the DC for saving throws, regardless of her actual key ability score, which could be higher.

        <p>You can increase the power limit of your damage-dealing spells.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Maximize Spell
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The damage cap for your spells increases by 10 dice (for spells that deal a number of dice of damage equal to your caster level, such as fireball) or by 5 dice (for spells that deal a number of dice of damage equal to half your level, such as searing light). An enhanced spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell&apos;s actual level. <br>For example, an enhanced fireball has a damage cap of 20d6 (rather than lod6). An enhanced searing light has a damage cap of 10d8 (rather than 5d8). <br>This feat has no effect on spells that don&apos;t specifically deal a number of dice of damage equal to your level or half your level, even if the spell&apos;s effect is largely dictated by your level. Thus, it has no effect on magic missile (even though your level indicates how many missiles you fire), Melf&apos;s acid arrow (even though your level indicates how many rounds the acid deals damage), or produce flame (even though you add your level to the base 1d4 damage dealt).
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You may gain this feat multiple times. Each time you select this feat, the damage cap increases by 10 dice or 5 dice, as appropriate to the spell, and the enhanced spell takes up a spell slot an additional four levels higher (thus, a twice-enhanced fireball would be an 11th-level spell).
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Without this feat, use the damage dice caps indicated in the spell&apos;s description.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Cha 19, Extra Turning, Heighten Turning, ability to turn or rebuke creatures.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you channel energy to turn, rebuke, command, or destroy undead, you roll turning damage twice and add the results together to determine the total number of Hit Dice of undead you affect. Using Enhance Turning is a full-round action.

        <p>The natural adhesive you secrete becomes stickier.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Kuo-toa.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When your shield is coated with your natural adhesive, it is more difficult than usual for an opponent to avoid becoming stuck to it and to break free once stuck. The DC for the opponent&apos;s Reflex save to avoid getting stuck after an unsuccessful melee attack increases by +2. The DC for the opponent&apos;s Strength check to free itself or its weapon after becoming stuck increases by the same amount.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: The DC for the Reflex save is 11 + your Constitution modifier. The only way to increase the DC is to increase your Constitution modifier. The DC for the Strength check is normally a flat value that cannot be increased.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Psychic aura class feature.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The radius of your psychic aura increases by 5 feet (the radius of your aura would be 10 feet at 1st level, instead of 5 feet).

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you manifest constructs, you create additional bonus constructs. You create 1d3 bonus constructs of at least two levels below the astral construct power you are manifesting. For example, when a 13th-level psion manifests astral construct VI, she not only gets to choose the construct that normally manifests with the spell, but she also receives 1d3 constructs of her choice of type from I to IV. </p><p><strong>Astral Construct Bonus Type</strong></p><ul><li>I - -- </li><li>II - -- </li><li>III - I </li><li>IV - I to II</li><li>V - I to III</li><li>VI - I to IV</li><li>VII - I to V</li><li>VIII - I to VI</li><li>IX - I to VII</li></ul><p>

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spell Focus (illusion), illusionist level 1st.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your illusion (shadow) spells deal one-fifth (20%) more real damage if disbelieved. For example, a creature summoned with a shadow conjuration spell deals two-fifths (40%) of the damage a real creature of the same kind would deal if the target of the spell disbelieves it, instead of only one-fifth (20%).

        <p>Your breath weapon is larger than normal.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Con 13, breach weapon.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The length of your breath weapon increases by 50% (round down to the nearest multiple of 5). For example, an old silver dragon breathing an enlarged cone of cold produces a 75-foot cone instead of a 50-foot cone. Cone-shaped breath weapons get wider when they get longer, but line-shaped breath weapons do not.<br>When you use this feat, add +1 to the number of rounds you must wait before using your breath weapon again.

        <p>An aboleth with this feat can extend its mucus cloud into a wider area.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Aboleth, Con 20.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The aboleth&apos;s mucus cloud extends to fill an area equal to its natural reach (a 10-foot radius for most aboleths).
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: On land, the aboleth&apos;s mucus cloud becomes a mucus puddle of an equal radius. The mucus can affect other beings in contact with the puddle (including any that move through it using their base land speed), but beings that jump or fly over it, or otherwise avoid the puddle, are safe.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: The aboleth&apos;s mucus cloud has a radius of only 1 foot.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see <a href="../../charbuild/skills/concentration.shtml#psionics">Concentration skill</a> description). You can alter a power with a range of close, medium, or long to increase its range by 100%. An enlarged power with a range of close has a range of 50 feet + 5 feet per level, a medium-range power has a range of 200 feet + 20 feet per level, and a long-range power has a range of 800 feet + 80 feet per level. Powers whose ranges are not defined by distance, as well as powers whose ranges are not close, medium, or long, are not affected.<br>Using this feat does not increase the power point cost of the power.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: An enlarged spell has its range doubled. Spells whose ranges are not defined by distance do not have their ranges increased. A spell whose area or effect is determined by its range (such as bless or a cone spell) has the dimensions of its area or effect increased proportionally.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: 4 HD, supernatural ability.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per day, you can enlarge a supernatural ability. When you use an enlarged supernatural ability, its range increases by 100%.

Enlarging a supernatural ability does not require a separate action.<br>This feat does not affect the length of a line or a cone, the diameter of an emanation (such as a gaze attack or frightful presence), or the range of any supernatural ability not defined by distance.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can enlarge a supernatural ability one additional time per day. You cannot enlarge a particular use of a supernatural ability more than once.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you use your breath weapon, you can choose to enmesh all creatures in its area instead of producing its normal effect. Your breath weapon deals only half its normal damage; however, any creature that takes damage from your breath weapon becomes entangled and takes an extra 1d6 points of damage, of the same energy type as normally dealt by your breath weapon, each round at the start of your turn. This effect lasts for 1d4 rounds.<br>If your breath weapon doesn&apos;t deal energy damage, creatures damaged by the initial breath are still entangled but don&apos;t take additional damage on later rounds.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The feat can be applied to any instantaneous spell that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, such as <em>fireball</em> or <em>lightning bolt</em>. After the spell is cast, lingering tendrils of raw energy persist; creatures damaged by the spell are entangled for 1 round. The spell is considered to be in effect during this time and can be dispelled normally. An entangling spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

If you break off combat with your target, you must restart the two rounds fighting with Combat Expertise before using this maneuver against that creature again. If you stop attacking that opponent, or he ceases attacking you, you must restart the two rounds fighting with Combat Expertise before using this maneuver against that opponent again. An opponent affected by this maneuver remains exhausted until the end of the encounter, at which time he becomes fatigued until he rests.<br><em>The Best Offense</em>: To use this maneuver, you must face a fatigued or exhausted opponent. You must then spend a round using the total defense action. The round after that, you must then attack your foe without using Combat Expertise at all. For that round, your foe is flat-footed against your attacks and you gain a +2 bonus on all attacks against that foe until your next turn.

        <p>You can cast spells that blast creatures off their feet.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: On a failed Reflex save, an explosive spell ejects any creature caught its area, sending it to a location outside the nearest edge of that area, dealing additional damage and further knocking creatures prone. For example, all creatures in the area of an <em>explosive fireball</em> that fail their saving throws not only take full damage but are pushed to the closest square outside the perimeter of the spell&apos;s 20-foot-radius spread. likewise, an <em>explosive lightning bolt</em> moves targets that fail their saves to outside the area defined by the squares the bolt&apos;s line passes through. Any creature moved in this manner also takes an additional 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet moved (no additional damage if moved less than 10 feet by the effect) and is knocked prone. If some obstacle prevents a blasted creature from being moved to the edge of the effect, the creature is stopped and takes 1d6 points of damage from striking the barrier (in addition to any damage taken from the distance moved before then). In any event, this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Explosive Spell can be applied only to spells that allow Reflex saves and affect an area (a cone, cylinder, line, or burst). An explosive spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

Initially, you gain the standard +2 bonus on damage and the usual skill checks against this new favored enemy. When you advance beyond the level at which you gained Extra Favored Enemy, this bonus increases in the same way other favored enemy bonuses do. For example, suppose you select goblinoids as your first favored enemy when you are a 1stlevel ranger and magical beasts as your second when you reach 5th level. You choose to allocate your extra +2 bonus against goblinoids, giving you a +4 bonus against goblinoids and a +2 bonus against magical beasts.

        <p>You are especially devout or insightful, and you have more control over which of your martial maneuvers are currently granted than other crusaders.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Crusader level 1st.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You begin each encounter with one additional readied maneuver granted. This feat also applies when you determine a new set of granted maneuvers after recovering expended maneuvers. For example, if you are a 5th-level crusader, you normally begin an encounter or finish recovering expended maneuvers with two of your five readied maneuvers granted, and the remaining three maneuvers withheld. With this feat, three of your five readied maneuvers are granted, and, only two are withheld. Naturally, this benefit provides you with a better array of maneuver options early in a battle.

        <p>You can draw upon the living essence of a willing or captured demon to fuel the creation of items or the casting of potent spells.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any two item creation feats, Demon Mastery.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you need to expend experience points to craft a magic item or cast a spell with an XP component, you can draw upon the life force of a nearby demon to reduce the XP cost to you. Before beginning the process, you must secure a demon whose Hit Dice equal or exceed the caster level of the item or spell in question. The demon could be one that you summoned with a planar ally spell, or one that you have bound with a planar binding spell, or even one that you simply encountered and convinced to aid you. The demon need not be willing, but it must remain within 30 feet of you for the duration of your work on the item or the casting time of the spell, and you must have line of effect (but not necessarily line of sight) to it during that time.<br>Drawing essence from a demon does not increase the time required to craft the item or cast the spell, but the process is draining for both you and the demon. Each of you rakes 1d6 points of Constitution damage when the essence is channeled from the demon into your body, then converted into magical energy.<br>An unwilling demon can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier) to resist removal of its essence. Success negates your use of this feat and forces you to either pay the full cost yourself or abort the creation or casting.<br>Successfully drawing essence from a demon in this way reduces the XP cost of the spell or item creation by one-half, but it complicates the process. If you use this feat to reduce the XP cost of a spell, you must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 20 + the demon&apos;s HD) to cast the spell. If you use this feat to offset the XP cost of crafting a magic item, the demon&apos;s essence has a 10% chance to corrupt the item in some way, imbuing it with a curse. (The DM determines the nature of this curse randomly by rolling on the tables on pages 272-273 of the Dungeon Master&apos;s Guide.)

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Concentration 15 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When concentrating to maintain a spell, you can make a Concentration check (DC 25 + spell level) to maintain concentration with just a move action. If you bear the DC by 10 or more, you can maintain concentration on the spell as a swift action. Using this ability is a free action, but if you fail the Concentration check, you lose concentration on the maintained spell and its effect ends.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain one extra spell slot in your daily allotment that you can use to cast any cerebrosis-granted spell you know. This extra slot can be at any level up to the highest level spell you can cast. If you prepare your spells, you must decide at the time of preparation for the day what level and what spell you&apos;d like for that day. If you cast your spells like a sorcerer, you have an extra &quot;floating&quot; slot that can be used at any time at any level with a cerebrosis spell you know.<br>The strain this ability demands upon your merely fleshy brain incurs a -2 penalty to your Wisdom score.

Each time you take it you gain an extra spell slot at any level that can be used to cast a cerebrosis-granted spell and you suffer an additional -2 penalty to your Wisdom score.

        <p>You are a member of one of the dragonmarked mercantile houses and wield some influence in that house. 
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Member of appropriate dragonmarked race and house. 
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your family is influential and powerful, and you have the ability to call in favors from other members of your family and their extensive contacts. By making a favor check (see below), you can call upon contacts to gain important information without going through the time and trouble of a Gather Information check. Favors can also be used to acquire the loan of equipment or documents from influential acquaintances. <br>To call in a favor, you make a favor check. Roll a d20 and add a bonus based on your character level:+1 at 1st-2nd level, +2 at 3rd-6th level, +3 at 7th-11th level, +4 at 12th-15th level, or +5 at 16th level or higher. The DM sets the DC based on the scope of the favor being requested; it can range from 10 for a simple favor to as high as 25 for highly dangerous, expensive, or illegal favors. You can&apos;t take 10 or take 20 on this check, nor can you retry the check for the same (or virtually the same)favor. Favors should help advance the plot of an adventure. A favor that would enable you to circumvent an adventure will always be unavailable to you, regardless of the result of a favor check. <br>You can try to call in a favor a number of times per week equal to one-half your character level, rounded down (minimum one). You can never ask for more than one favor from any one contact in a given week. For instance, at 7th level you can try to call in a favor as many as three times per week, but each attempt must involve a different contact from among those associated with your mercantile house. <br>The DM will carefully monitor your use of favors to ensure that you don&apos;t abuse this ability. The success or failure of a mission shouldn&apos;t hinge on the use of a favor, and calling in favors shouldn&apos;t replace good roleplaying or the use of other skills. The DM may disallow any favor he or she deems disruptive to the campaign.

        <p>Creatures subjected to your necromantic spells feel the chill of fear.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spell Focus (necromancy) or necromancer level 1st.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Any foe required to save against a necromancy spell you cast is shaken for 1 round, regardless of the result of the save. This mind-affecting fear ability does not stack with any other fear effect (it can&apos;t make a foe worse than shaken).
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A necromancer can select this feat as a wizard bonus feat.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: If you make a successful Bluff check against your opponent&apos;s Sense Motive check, you lure the foe into attempting an attack of opportunity because he thinks you are unarmed.

        <p>Living foes damaged by your spell also gain a negative level.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can alter a spell that deals damage to foes so that any living creature that is dealt damage also gains a negative level. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as Hit Dice, it dies. Assuming the subject survives, the negative level disappears (without requiring a Fortitude save) after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 15). A fell draining spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

        <p>Living foes slain by your spell may rise as zombies.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can alter a spell that deals damage to foes. Any living creature that could normally be raised as a zombie and that does not possess more than double your Hit Dice, when slain outright by a fell animated spell, rises as a zombie under your control at the beginning of your next action. Even if you kill several creatures with a single fell animated spell, you can&apos;t create more Hit Dice of undead than twice your caster level. The standard rules for controlling undead (see animate dead, page 198 of the Player&apos;s Handbook) apply to newly created undead gained through this metamagic feat. A fell animated spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

        <p>You add a dose of raw necromantic energy to your beneficial spell, making it especially effective for undead creatures.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Any numerical bonus granted by a spell modified with this feat increases by +2 for all undead creatures it affects. This increase does not apply to factors such as range, save DC, healing, or other numerical factors relating to a spell. Only effects described as bonuses gain this benefit. A fell energy spell takes up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can alter a spell that deals damage to foes so that any creature subject to fear effects and mind-affecting spells and abilities that is dealt damage also becomes shaken for 1 minute.

        <p>You can enslave a feral animal and adopt it as your animal companion.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Animal companion class feature, evil alignment.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Instead of calling a normal animal companion, you can call a feral animal companion that foams at the mouth. Any creature harmed by the animal&apos;s bite attack must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract red ache (see Dungeon Master&apos;s Guide page 292). The disease has no harmful effect on the feral animal. In addition, your feral animal companion gains a +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution. Attempts by others to influence your feral animal companion with Handle Animal checks take a -10 penalty.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: This feat does not transform a normal animal companion into a feral animal companion.

        <p>Living foes damaged by your spell are also weakened.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can alter a spell that deals damage to foes so that any living creature that is dealt damage also takes a -4 penalty to Strength for 1 minute. Strength penalties from multiple spells enhanced by the Fell Weakening feat do not stack. A fell weakening spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

        <p><strong>Type</strong>: Bloodline
            <br><strong>Sources:</strong>  Dragon #311<br> Dragon Compendium Vol. 1<br></p>
        <p>One of your ancestors was a fey creature, or was raised as such. Fey sometimes take humanoid mates, or capture children and raise them as their own. Fey-blooded characters vary greatly in appearance, but most have some odd feature that marks them, such as a strange eye or hair color.<br>The heirs of dryads are often quite shy, but they possess quick minds and an earthy sort of beauty. Grig-blooded characters are mischievous and light-hearted, while those with pixie blood are prone to take their pranks too far. Characters with nixie blood are suspicious beings who tend to avoid strangers but remain fiercely loyal to places or persons they love.<br>Sorcerers with fey blood often have changing, fickle natures. They are quick to laugh and play tricks, but slow to forgive or forget slights. They adventure primarily out of a sense of alienation, seeking some place or group to which they can belong. They are fond of spells that deceive and manipulate emotions, such as charm person.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your ancestry grants you a bonus spell known at each spell level, starting at 1st, according to the following list.</p><ul><li>1. Detect secret doors</li><li>2. Glitterdust</li><li>3. Tongues</li><li>4. Hallucinatory terrain</li><li>5. Seeming</li><li>6. Mislead</li><li>7. Sequester</li><li>8. Otto&apos;s irresistible dance</li><li>9. Wail of the banshee</li></ul><p>
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If a character takes this feat any time after 1st level and has already learned any of the spells on this list in the class that granted him access to this feat, he gains no additional spells known at those spell levels. This restriction does not apply if he learned any of these spells as a member of another spellcasting class.<br>Although folklore often associates fey creatures with the spirits of the dead, this belief could not be further from the truth - in fact, all fey are inherently bound to life. Thus, characters with the Fey Bloodline feat cannot learn or cast spells that create or control undead, and all such spells are removed from the spell lists of all their spellcasting classes.

        <p>One of your distant ancestors was an evil outsider. The characteristics you display might depend in part on the kind of fiendish heritage you have. Many of your bloodline are dark in coloration, although great variation can exist depending on your specific ancestry.<br>Evil outsiders such as demons and devils produce a surprisingly large number of offspring on the Material Plane. Their descendants are frequently (but not always) evil. Demon-blooded characters and others descended from beings native to the chaotic evil realms are usually chaotic themselves, and at their worst they can be prone to greedy or lustful behavior. Those with devil-blood, on the other hand, tend to be lawful. They have no compunctions about bending the rules as far as possible, but they rarely break them. Like their fiendish ancestors, devil-spawn are known for keeping their word.<br>Characters with fiendish blood often seem driven - even haunted - by the potential for evil within them, especially if they try to hold to a neutral or good path. They frequently adventure out of a restlessness caused by their own internal struggles, although sometimes they do so simply because they enjoy killing, and adventuring provides a perfect outlet for that tendency. Such characters usually prefer spells of darkness and deception, even if they are good-aligned.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your ancestry gives you a bonus spell known at each spell level, starting at 1st, according to the following list.</p><ul><li>1.

        <p>One of your ancestors was a creature of elemental fire. Your physical characteristics might vary with the type of elemental creature from which you are descended, but you&apos;re likely to have wild red or coal black hair, and either smoky gray or golden eyes. Your heritage probably stems from one of the humanoid-shaped beings from the Plane of Elemental Fire, although elemental fire creatures native to the Material Plane can contribute this bloodline as well.<br>The Descendants of azers see fire as a tool, and they love crafts that control the power of flame. They tend to prefer a regimented life and usually keep their destructive natures in tight check, although they are no less dangerous because of that forbearance. The descendants of fire mephits have a mischievous nature and enjoy destructive pranks, while characters with steam mephits in their ancestry consider themselves above such behavior and often look down on others with considerable arrogance. Fire giant spawn can be ruthless in achieving their goals, and even others with fire blood see them as brutal. None, however, can be as cruel as the descendants of salamanders.<br>Usually hot-tempered and unpredictable, characters with the Fire Bloodline feat can also be passionate, egotistical, and unusually prone to destructive behavior. They usually adventure for a chance at personal gain and glory. Fire holds a primal fascination and fear for most creatures, and scions of this bloodline use that to their advantage, often choosing mind-affecting spells to supplement their preferred destructive flame spells.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your ancestry gives you a bonus spell known at each spell level, starting at 1st, according to the following list.</p><ul><li>1. Hypnotism</li><li>2.

            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If a character takes this feat any time after 1st level and has already learned any of the spells on this list in the class that granted him access to this feat, he gains no additional spells known at those spell levels. This restriction does not apply if he learned any of these spells as a member of another spellcasting class.<br>Characters with this feat cannot learn or cast spells with the water descriptor, and all such spells are removed from the spell lists of all their spellcasting classes.

        <p>You have studied a martial style practiced by monks devoted to the Mockery, which has taught you to cut your opponent&apos;s skin in a very painful way. 
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Exotic Weapon Proficiency (kama), Weapon Focus (kama). 
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Using Flensing Strike is a full-round action. Make an attack roll with your kama. If you hit a living, corporeal foe, that creature must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier), in addition to taking damage normally. The DC is increased by 2 if you are wielding; two kamas (creatures wielding more than two kamas gain no additional bonuses). <br>The target adds his natural armor bonus, if any, as a bonus on this saving throw. A target that fails the saving throw is wracked with pain, receiving a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks for 1 minute. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits, and creatures with a special immunity to pain are not susceptible to this feat. 
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: An evil monk may select Flensing Strike as a bonus feat at 2nd or 6th level if she meets the prerequisites.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Str 19, Rock Hurling or racial ability to throw rocks, size large or larger (goliaths qualify by virtue of their powerful build racial trait).
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can pick up an ally at least one size category smaller than you and throw him toward a specific square up to five range increments away. It takes a move action to pick up an ally and a standard action to throw that ally. You make a ranged touch attack (against AC 5) to throw the ally to the chosen square. If the touch attack hits, the ally lands in the square you designate. If the touch attack is a miss, randomly determine in which square the ally lands, using the Missing with a Thrown Weapon diagram on page 158 of the <em><strong>Player&apos;s Handbook</strong></em>. If the ally lands in a square that is occupied, she lands prone in that square. in any case, the ally doesn&apos;t provoke attacks of opportunity for this movement.<br>Allies one size category smaller than you have a range increment of 5 feet, while allies two size categories or more smaller than you have a range increment of 15 feet. If you have the improved Rock Hurling feat or the racial ability to throw rocks, the range increments improve to 20 feet and 40 feet respectively. <br>Goliaths are treated as Large creatures for the purpose of this feat, allowing them to fling Medium allies with a range increment of 5 feet and Small or smaller allies with a range increment of 15 feet.<br>You must be strong enough to lift the ally over your head (the ally&apos;s weight cannot exceed your character&apos;s maximum load) to throw her. See page 162 of the <strong>Player&apos;s Handbook</strong> for more information on carrying capacity and maximum load.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you&apos;re grappling a foe, you can fling that foe away from you with a successful grapple check. Flinging the enemy requires a standard action. For every 5 points by which your grapple check beats your foe&apos;s grapple check or Escape Artist check, you can throw that foe 10 feet. Your foe lands prone in the square you designate. You can&apos;t throw a foe farther than you could throw an ally (as described in the Fling Ally feat). You must be strong enough to lift an enemy over your head (the enemy&apos;s weight cannot exceed your character&apos;s maximum load) to throw him. See page 162 of the <strong><em>Player&apos;s Handbook</em></strong> for more information on carrying capacity and maximum load.<br>The enemy does not provoke attacks of opportunity for this movement.

        <p>When you catch opponents unawares you can unleash a storm of shuriken striking at their most vulnerable points.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Dex 13, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Rapid Shot, Weapon Focus (shuriken), Acrobatics, sudden strike +4d6.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As part of a full-round attack using Rapid Shot, you can throw additional shuriken by reducing your sudden strike damage. You make every attack in the round with a -2 penalty. For each die by which you reduce your sudden strike damage you gain one additional attack and you deal your remaining damage dice to each target struck by the additional attacks gained from this ability. You can sacrifice up to three bonus damage dice to gain three extra attacks in a round. Each target of a shuriken attack must be vulnerable to your sudden strike (i.e., does not currently have a Dexterity bonus to AC), and each shuriken you throw in this way must target a different creature. Other attacks you make as part of your full attack action that are not extra attacks from Rapid Shot or Flurry of Throws do not have to be made with shuriken, and they do not gain bonus sudden strike damage.<br>For example, a 13th-level ninja uses Rapid Shot and Hurry of Throws to make six attacks (two normal attacks plus one Rapid Shot attack plus three Flurry of Throws attacks). The ninja&apos;s attacks have the following base attack bonuses (counting only his base attack bonus and penalties for attacking more than once in around): +6/+1/+6/+6/+6/+6. His three Flurry of Throws attacks deal normal shuriken damage plus 4d6 points of sudden strike damage and must be made against three different foes who lack their Dexterity bonuses to AC and are thus susceptible to sudden strike damage.

In the current round, she attempts to make stunning attack with her quarterstaff. She succeeds and the opponent is stunned, so she can immediately attempt a bull rush against the stunned opponent, so she moves only the initial 5 feet, she may still use her second attack at a base attack bonus of +1 against the stunned opponent or anyone in her new threatened area.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spellcaster level 12th+
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can create any ring whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a ring takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a ring, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing half of its base price. See the DUNGEON MASTER&apos;S Guide for descriptions of rings, the prerequisites associated with each one, and their prices. You can also mend a broken ring if it is a ring that you could make. Doing so costs half the XP, half the raw materials, and half the time it would take to craft that ring in the first place. Some magic rings incur extra costs in material components or XP as noted in their descriptions. For example: a ring of three wishes costs 15,000 XP in addition to costs derived front its base price (as much XP as it costs to cast wish three times). You must pay such a cost to create a ring or to mend a broken one.

        <p> You can manifest powers to greater effect
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: All variable, numeric effects of an fortified power are increased by one-quarter (minimum of 1). A fortified power deals an extra twenty-five percent damage, cures twenty-five percent as many hit points, affects twenty-five percent more targets, and so on, as appropriate. For example, a fortified <em>lesser concussion</em> deals twenty-five percent more damage (roll 1d6 and multiply the result by 1.25, with a minimum extra damage of 1). Saving throws and opposed rolls (such as the one you make when you manifest negate psionics) are not affected. Powers without random variables are not affected. A fortified power costs a number of power points equal to its standard cost + 2.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can apply Fortify Power to the same power multiple times. Each time you apply it, the power is fortified another twenty-five percent, and it costs 2 more power points. For instance, a <em>lesser concussion</em> fortified 3 times deals 1d6 x 1.75 damage for a cost of 7 power points. You can&apos;t break the power point limit of the manifester level minus one when using Fortify Power multiple times on the same power. Thus, an 8th-level manifester could have used the power as described in the above example, while a 7th-level caster could not, though he could use Fortify Power twice on <em>lesser concussion</em> so that it deals 1d6 x 1.5 damage, for a cost of 5 power points.

You prepare and cast the spell in a higher-level spell slot than normal, with each additional level giving a +2 bonus on spell penetration checks for the altered spell. Spells that are not subject to spell resistance are not affected.<br>A fortified spell uses up a spell slot at least one level higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

This ability cannot reduce an object&apos;s hardness or damage reduction below 0.<br>As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 insight bonus on all sunder attempts that you make.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Constitution 11 or lower.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you fail a Fortitude save, you become fatigued, in addition to any other effects you might suffer. This condition lasts until you get 8 hours of complete rest. This flaw applies only once to any given source that requires a Fortitude save. Failing a Fortitude save while fatigued causes you to become exhausted.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Wis 17, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist, base attack bonus +10.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a missed attack roll ruins the attempt). Against a humanoid opponent, you can make an unarmed attack that deals no damage but has a chance of paralyzing your target. If your attack is successful, your target must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier). If the target fails this saving throw, it is paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. Each attempt to paralyze an opponent counts as one of your uses of the Stunning Fist feat for the day. Creatures immune to stunning cannot be paralyzed in this manner.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Corrupting Touch.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can make a touch attack that deals 1d6 points of cold damage. When you are manifested fully or attacking incorporeal opponents, you add your Strength modifier to attack rolls. When you are incorporeal, you add your Dexterity modifier to attack rolls, if the attack scores a critical hit, the damage is doubled (ghosts are not subject to critical hits). Only one kind of damage or effect from the path of the corrupter applies from each attack.<br>You do not have to use this ability when you touch another creature, and creatures that touch you do not take this damage.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: A ghost&apos;s touch attack normally deals no damage.

        <p>You can channel the divine to send yourself into a powerful but dangerous alternative state of being.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Base attack bonus +6, ability to turn or rebuke undead, must have either witnessed the Wild Hunt taking place or have been hunted by the Master of the Hunt&apos;s followers.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can spend a turn or rebuke attempt as a free action to enter into a wild state of frenzy. Your base attack bonus becomes equal to your character level (which might grant you extra attacks), you gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, and a +4 enhancement bonus on all Listen and Spot checks. Due to the focused bloodlust of the frenzy you can only use physical attacks, favoring ranged (or thrown) attacks when possible. You cannot cast spells or take any other action that requires concentration as long as the frenzy lasts.<br>Much like the Master of the Hunt, when in this alternative state of mind you seek only to kill prey. You consider any non-allied creatures within your line of sight as prey. Once a creature you designate as prey falls you stop attacking and move on to another creature. Despite the bloodlust you can always differentiate between friend and foe.<br>To determine the number of rounds the frenzy lasts, roll a turning check (1d20 + Cha modifier) and consult Turning Undead (in the PH). The duration of the frenzy equals the maximum Hit Dice of undead you could affect with that turning check. If you down all available prey before the frenzy ends you immediately begin a hunt, searching for more prey. During this time you go to any length to find another suitable creature to hunt, even if it means risking life and limb. You may attempt to end the frenzy early by succeeding at a Will save (DC 15 + rounds remaining of the frenzy). You can attempt this Will save once per round. At the end of the frenzy you lose all of its benefits and become fatigued for a number of minutes equal to the number of rounds you spent in the frenzied state.

With a successful DC 25 Diplomacy check, you may requisition a spell cast by an Olman spellcaster. You may request this spell once per week and it is always cast by a spellcaster of the lowest level able to cast the spell. This free spell can have an expensive material component up to 100 gp X your character level or a focus worth up to double that. The spell&apos;s level can be no higher than 1/4 your character level.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Swallow whole special attack.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can swallow a creature of up to your own size category. Swallowing a creature as big as yourself, however, is a time-consuming process. Once you have established a hold against such a creature, you make a new grapple check as usual, but success indicates only that you have begun to swallow. On the following round, you must make an additional grapple check to complete the swallowing. The held creature can fight or try to break the grapple as normal while you are attempting to swallow it.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Your gullet can hold one creature of the maximum size. Other maximum numbers of swallowed creatures remain the same.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Unless otherwise noted, a creature can swallow opponents up to one size category smaller than itself.

        <p>You know how to tune your damaging spells to affect ghosts without harming other creatures.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: A ghost-touch spell affects only ghosts and does no damage to other creatures. Ghosts are affected whether incorporeal or manifested fully and do not have the benefit of their incorporeal miss chance. This metamagic feat works only on spells that deal damage. For example, a ghost-touch <em>fireball</em> cast by a 5th-level wizard deals 5d6 points of fire damage to ghosts, but is harmless to any other creatures in the area. Damaging spells with additional effects not related to damage (such as the ability of a <em>wall of ice</em> to function as a barrier) still affect non-ghosts (but if a non-ghost passed through an opening in the wall of ice, he would not take any damage from the spell). A ghost-touch spell takes up a slot of the same level as the spell&apos;s actual level.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Base attack bonus +3
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You must be psionically focused to use this feat. When you make a melee attack or a ranged attack against an incorporeal creature, you can make two rolls to check for the miss chance. If either is successful, the attack is treated as if it were made with a ghost touch weapon for the purpose of affecting the creature. Your weapon or natural weapon actually appears to become briefly incorporeal as the attack is made.

        <p>You can hide within the physical body of a living creature, perceiving the world through its senses, but without the ability to control the host.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a standard action, you can attempt to inhabit the physical body of a living creature. You must enter your targets space, which provokes an attack of opportunity from the target. The target may resist with a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Cha modifier). A creature that saves against this ability is immune to your attempts to use any feat on the path of the dominator for one day. If the save is failed, your ghost body and any ghost touch equipment you carry vanishes into the target&apos;s physical body (non-ghost touch items you carry drop to the ground in the target&apos;s square). The target gets another Will saving throw every 10 minutes to force you our of its body, causing your ghost body to appear in an adjacent space to your target. This is a mind-affecting ability. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).<br>Unlike <em>magic jar</em>, you do not control the target, but simply ride along in the target&apos;s body. You see, hear, smell, feel, and taste what the subject does. You may remain within a host for a number of minutes equal to 10 x your Hit Dice, after which you are expelled automatically When you leave a body, any ghost touch equipment you were carrying with you at the start of the possession reforms with your ghost body. You may use this feat only on creatures of the same type as you (humanoids may ride only humanoids, for example).

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Medium or smaller size, Tumble 5 ranks, base attack bonus +6.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The Giantbane feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers.<br><strong>Duck Underneath</strong>: To use this maneuver, you must have taken a total defense action, then have been attacked by a foe at least two size categories larger than you. You gain a +4 dodge bonus to your Armor Class, which stacks with the bonus for total defense. If that foe misses you, on your next turn, as a free action, you may make a DC 15 Tumble check. If the check succeeds, you move immediately to any unoccupied square on the opposite side of the foe (having successfully ducked underneath your foe). If there is no unoccupied square on the opposite side of the foe or you fail the Tumble check, you remain in the square you are in and have failed to duck underneath your foe.<br><strong>Death from Below</strong>: To use this maneuver, you must have successfully used the duck underneath maneuver. You may make an immediate single attack against the foe you ducked underneath. That foe is treated as flat-footed, and you gain a +4 bonus on your attack roll.<br><strong>Climb Aboard</strong>: To use this maneuver, you must move adjacent to a foe at least two size categories larger than you. In the following round, you may make a DC 10 Climb check as a free action to clamber onto the creature&apos;s back or limbs (you move into one of the squares the creature occupies). The creature you&apos;re standing on takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls against you, because it can strike at you only awkwardly. If the creature moves during its action, you move along with it. The creature can try to shake you off by making a grapple check opposed by your Climb check. If the creature succeeds, you wind up in a random adjacent square.

You spend one daily use of each spell-like ability used in this combination.</p><ul><li><i>Curtain of Darkness</i>: You can expend one daily use of <i>dancing lights</i> and <i>darkness</i> to extinguish all nonmagical light sources within 100 feet. This is not a magical darkness effect; the fires (or other sources, such as sunrods) simply go out. This ability does not function on any flame larger than that of a torch or lantern, so it cannot be used to extinguish a burning building or as a defense against fire used as a weapon. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.</li><li><i>Mirror Image</i>: You can expend one daily use of <i>dancing lights</i> and <i>faerie fire</i> to use <i>mirror image</i> (as the spell, except you gain only 1d4 images).</li><li><i>See Invisibility</i>: You can expend one daily use of <i>darkness</i> and <i>faerie fire</i> to use <i>see invisibility</i> (as the spell, except the duration is only 1 round per caster level).</li><li><i>Blinding Vanish</i>: You can expend one daily use of <i>dancing lights</i>, <i>darkness</i>, and <i>faerie fire</i> to disappear in a blinding flash of light. All creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst are blinded for 1 round; a successful Fortitude save (DC 14 + your Cha modifier) reduces the effect to dazzled for 1 round.

        <p>Goblin raiding parties whisper of the crazed but effective tactics that gnome tunnel guards use to defend their homes. The gnomes excel at using acrobatics to penetrate enemy ranks or launch devastating attacks from above.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Gnome; or base attack bonus +4, Knowledge (dungeoneering) 2 ranks, and Tumble 9 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The Gnome Tunnel Acrobatics feat enables the use of certain tactical maneuvers, described below.</p><p><em>Combat Puppeteer</em>: You slip between your foes in a blur of movement, confusing them and causing them to strike at each other by mistake. If you use the Tumble skill to avoid an opponent&apos;s attack of opportunity, you can use this maneuver on the following round. You must make a double move and attempt a Tumble check at a -5 penalty to avoid a foe&apos;s attack of opportunity. If your check succeeds, your foe makes an attack of opportunity but targets a creature of your choice within its reach rather than you. You can use this maneuver against one creature per round.</p><p><em>Tunnel Scrambler</em>: Using a series of deft tumbles and somersaults, you crowd your opponent and force him to move. If you make a successful melee attack against an opponent who has walls adjacent to at least two sides of his space, you can make a special Tumble check on your next turn. This check requires a full-round action. As part of this action, make a Tumble check to move through the target&apos;s space. On a successful check, you stop in his space (rather than move past him) and attack as part of your full-round action. If the check fails, you provoke an attack of opportunity, and the rest of your full-round action is wasted.<br>If your melee attack hits, you move your foe 5 feet in a direction of your choice. You now occupy the space that he occupied (or one of the spaces of your choice). If your melee attack misses, you return to the space you occupied when you started this maneuver.</p><p><em>Wail Leaper</em>: If you drop from a wall while climbing and land adjacent to a creature, you can make one attack as a standard action. This attack counts as a charge, and you gain a bonus on your damage roll equal to the number of points of falling damage that you take.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A fighter can select Gnome Tunnel Acrobatics as one of his fighter bonus feats.

(The goad is a mind-affecting ability.) When the goaded opponent starts its next turn, if it threatens you and has line of sight to you, it must make a Will saving throw (DC 10+ 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier). If the opponent fails its save, you are the only creature it can make melee attacks against during this turn. (If it kills you, knocks you unconscious, loses sight of you, or otherwise is unable to make melee attacks against you, it may make any remaining melee attacks against other foes, as normal.) A goaded creature can still cast spells, make ranged attacks, move, or perform other actions normally. The use of this feat restricts only melee attacks.

Alternatively, you could have the dwarf take a 5-foot step and the elf cast <em>summon monster I</em> (a full round action), leaving the human with no actions for the round. Since relaxing control on a host is a free action, you can allow any or all of your hosts to act normally in the same round without penalty.<br>When you leave your last possessed host, your ghost touch equipment reappears with your reformed ghost body.<br>A creature that saves against this ability is immune to your attempts to use any feat on the path of the dominator for one day.

        <p>You become more efficient at psionic combat.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Psionic Combat Buffer
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You have developed a psionic combat power point buffer that allows you to activate psionic attack and defense modes at 1/3 the normal cost. If you maintain a reserve of at least 3 power points in your buffer, the cost to activate some combat modes can be reduced to zero, otherwise the minimum cost is 1 power point. You may choose to designate a maximum of half of your total power points per day as buffer points for use in psionic combat only (subject to available power points -- you cannot spend what you do not have). You can do this at any time, but charging the buffer is a full-round action. If in combat while charging the buffer, you are considered flat-footed for that round of psionic combat. You can use power points stored in the buffer only for psionic defense and attack modes, and they have a duration of 1 hour per manifester level. Once the duration has been reached, no additional power points can be placed in the buffer that day. Half of any unused points are returned to the character at the end of the duration; the remaining half dissipates harmlessly. The buffer may be dismissed at any time and is treated as though it had reached its duration.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Only those spells delivered by a ranged touch attack can be guided. Choose a target within range before casting a guided spell.

If the target or you move out of the range of the spell, if the target gains total cover or concealment from your position, or if the line of effect for the spell is blocked, the guided spell duration immediately ends. You do not need to concentrate on a guided spell while it is attacking. A guided spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

        <p>You are a master of the style of fighting with a hammer and sword at the same time, and have learned to hammer your foes into the ground with your tremendous blows.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Str 15, improved Bull Rush, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Focus (bastard sword, longsword, or scimitar), Weapon Focus (warhammer or light hammer).
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: If you hit the same creature with both your sword and your hammer in the same round, it must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Str modifier) or fall prone.

        <h1>Hamstring Attack</h1>
        <p><strong>Type</strong>: General
            <br><strong>Source:</strong>  Dragon #313<br></p>
        <p>When you strike a vulnerable foe, you instinctively attack in ways that can significantly slow your enemies.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Str 13, Dex 15, base attack bonus +4.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you use a natural weapon to make a successful attack while flanking, attack of opportunity, or attack against an opponent who is stunned or prone, you may choose to deal Dexterity damage instead of normal damage. Roll the damage for the attack normally; the result is the DC for the target&apos;s Fortitude save against the effect. A creature that fails the Fortitude save takes id4 points of Dexterity damage. Success negates the damage. You must indicate your intention to use this feat before you roll damage.

        <p>You can wound your opponents&apos; legs, hampering their movement.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Sneak attack ability, base attack bonus +4.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: If you hit with a melee sneak attack, you may choose to forgo 2d6 points of extra sneak attack damage to reduce your opponent&apos;s base speed by half. This speed reduction ends after 24 hours have passed or a successful DC 15 Heal check or the application of any <em>cure</em> spell or other magical healing is made. Creatures immune to sneak attack damage and creatures with no legs or more than four legs can&apos;t be slowed down with a hamstring attack. It takes two successful hamstring attacks to affect quadrupeds. Other speeds (fly, burrow, and so on) aren&apos;t affected. You may use this ability once per round.

        <p>Your hand crossbow attacks gain accuracy and speed.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Proficiency with hand crossbow, base attack bonus +1.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can reload a hand crossbow as a free action. You also gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls with a hand crossbow. This bonus does not stack with the bonus from Weapon Focus, but it is the equivalent of Weapon Focus for the purpose of qualifying for feats, prestige classes, and anything else that requires the feat.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A fighter can select Hand Crossbow Focus as a fighter bonus feat.

        <p>You have sacrificed your right hand to Tyr, the Maimed God, proving your resilience and strength of spirit. Most who take this feat wrap their right hands in white gauze, voluntarily refraining from using the hand. Others have lost their hand in battle, and a few fanatical followers of the Maimed God choose to cut off their hand to demonstrate their zeal and devotion to Tyr&apos;s faith.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Patron Tyr, alignment lawful good, ability to turn undead.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As long as you refrain from using your tight hand, you receive a +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and Will saves.<br>Since you are using only one hand, you cannot fight with two weapons, wield a two-handed weapon, or fight with a one-handed weapon and a heavy shield. You cam fight with a one-handed weapon and a light shield, but you cannot use your shield hand to hold other objects such as a holy symbol; spell components, or a light source. (This means you must use your weapon hand to cast spells, so you might have to drop or sheathe a weapon when you wish to cast a spell requiring your holy symbol or somatic components.) You take a -4 penalty on Climb, Disable Device, Open Lock, and Tumble checks. You can only gain the benefit of wearing one magic ring.<br>(If you previously considered yourself right-handed, you suffer no penalty for using your left hand as your primary hand. Handedness isn&apos;t defined in the game; the point of the vow is to restrict yourself to using one hand.)
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If you violate your oaths and use your right hand for any purpose, you lose the benefits of this feat until you perform a rite of purification in a shrine or temple of Tyr, which requires 24 hours of vigil and prayer.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When determining how many hit points you can cure, treat your Charisma score as if it were 2 points higher. For example, a 7th-level paladin with a 16 Charisma could cure up to 28 points of damage per day with this feat.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Int 13, arcane caster level 14th.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can designate one object that you own and can lift on your own without magical aid. The object must have been in your possession for at least a week and a day. Once designated, you can have the item fly to your hand(s) via telekinesis as long as you can see it and have line of effect to it. The item travels to you in 1 round, avoiding obstacles, regardless of distance. This is a free action. <br>Further, the item can be conjured to appear instantaneously in your hand from any distance once per week. This requires a full round of concentration.<br>You may designate a new object only if the previous item is destroyed. Otherwise, your choice is permanent and cannot be changed. The new object must meet all the same requirements of this feat as the previous item.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You may take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you must choose a different item.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to manifest any one force power and cast any one spell with an energy descriptor.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose any number of damage dice up to one-half the total dealt by the effect to which you are applying this feat. This amount becomes force damage (like that of a <em>magic missile</em>) instead of its former energy type. This portion of the damage bypasses all energy resistance but is still subject to spell resistance.<br>The hard energy half of the damage can affect incorporeal creatures, ignoring the standard miss chance. The remaining energy damage of the spell or power remains subject to the standard 50% miss chance with respect to an incorporeal target.<br>To apply Harden Energy to a spell, the caster must expend 3 power points per spell level. To apply it to a psionic power, the manifester must spend 1 spell level per power level.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one of your spell-like abilities (subject to the restrictions below) to use at a heightened level up to three times per day (or the ability&apos;s normal use limit, whichever is less). The spell-level equivalent of the heightened spell-like ability is two higher than its normal level (to a maximum of 9th level), with all effects dependent on spell level (including saving throw DCs) calculated at the higher level.<br>The spell-like ability you wish to heighten can be chosen only from those abilities that duplicate a spell of a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down), minus 2. For a summary, see the Caster Level to Empower column in the table on page 304 of the<em><strong> Monster Manual</strong></em>.

        <p>You can cast a spell as if it were higher level than it actually is.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: A heightened spell has a higher spell level than normal (up to 9th level). Unlike other metamagic feats, Heighten Spell actually increases the effective level of the spell that it modifies. All effects dependent on spell level (such as saving throw DCs and ability to penetrate a minor globe of invulnerability) are calculated according to the heightened level. The heightened spell is as difficult to prepare and cast as a spell of its effective level. For example, a cleric could prepare hold person as a 4th-level spell (instead of a 2nd-level spell), and it would in all ways be treated as a 4th-level spell.

If you roll a natural 20 on your attack roll when delivering the spell (assuming one is necessary) and the target fails its save, the spell deals double damage.<br><em>Conduit of Death</em>: Two conduits of negative energy (rebuking and dealing damage) reinforce each other, making your inflict spells more potent. To use this maneuver, you must first attempt to rebuke undead, then make an attack with an inflict spell (or other negative-energy spell) against a living creature in the following round. You gain a bonus on your damage roll for the spell equal to one-half the result of the initial turning check, and the save DC increases by an amount equal to your Charisma bonus (if any). Furthermore, the critical threat range of the attack increases by 1.<br><em>Touch of Death</em>: The negative energy you channel lingers, increasing the severity of the wounds you inflict. To use this maneuver, you must first cast an inflict spell, then attempt a melee attack against a living creature in the following round. If the attack hits, it deals extra damage equal to twice the level of the inflict spell cast.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Cha 15, Hostile Mind.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you are subject to a power from the telepathy discipline (regardless of whether the power is harmful or beneficial to you), the manifester must make a Will saving throw against a DC of 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier, and takes an additional 2d6 points of damage, plus 2d6 points from your Hostile Mind feat, for a total of 4d6 points of damage.<br>The benefit of this feat applies only to psionic powers and psi-like abilities.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Fly speed.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: While hovering, the creature can attack with all its natural weapons, except for wing attacks. Some creatures may be able to make additional attacks while hovering, as noted in the creature&apos;s descriptive test. If the creature has a breath weapon, it can use the breath weapon instead of making physical attacks.<br>If a creature hovers close to the ground in an area with lots of loose debris, the draft from its wings creates a hemispherical cloud with a radius specified in the creature&apos;s descriptive text. The winds so generated can snuff torches, small campfires, exposed lanterns, and other small, open flames of nonmagical origin. The cloud obscures vision, and creatures caught within it are blinded while inside and for 1 round after emerging. Each creature caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2 creature&apos;s HD) to cast a spell.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: A creature without this feat cannot halt its forward motion without falling. A creature with average, poor, or clumsy maneuverability can slow its flying movement to only half of its fly speed. (see Tactical Aerial Movement in the DUNGEON MASTER&apos;s Guide.)

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You are treated as a humanoid with the human-subtype for the purpose of adjudicating all effects.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Quick Draw, base attack bonus +6.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: If you charge an opponent, you may make a ranged attack with a thrown weapon as well as a melee attack with another weapon that you draw during the charge. You may use this feat only if you have a throwing weapon in hand at the start of your turn. Both attacks must be made at the same opponent, and both receive the bonus on attack rolls for making a charge. (If you kill the enemy you&apos;re charging with the thrown weapon, you complete the charge but don&apos;t get a melee attack.) You must also follow all the requirements of making a charge. If you have the ability to make multiple attacks on a charge, you may make only one attack in addition to the thrown weapon attack. You still take the normal -2 penalty to Armor Class for making a charge attack.

This requires a standard action and functions much like a bull rush; roll 1d20 + the level of the highest-level air spell you have available to cast opposed by your opponent&apos;s Strength check. If you succeed, you push the creature back 5 feet.<br>As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level when casting air spells.

If your grapple check is successful, your victim takes 2d4 points of Intelligence damage and grants you a number of temporary power points equal to the amount of intelligence damage you deal. Any creature reduced to Intelligence 0 by this attack is instantly slain.<br>Temporary power points gained with this feat last for 1 hour, and power points granted by this feat do not stack with each other.<br>This ability is useless against constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, and undead. It is not instantly fatal to opponents with multiple heads, such as ettins and hydras.

        <p>You embrace more of your illithid heritage, and grow at least one long purplish tentacle that you can reveal and unfurl when you open your mouth.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Illithid Heritage, one other illithid feat.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain a natural tentacle attack. If you can use weapons, you retain that ability, as well as any other natural weapons you have. If you are fighting without weapons, you can use your tentacle or another natural weapon as a primary attack. If you are armed with a weapon, you can use your tentacle or your weapon as a primary attack. If you make a full attack, you can use the weapon as your primary attack along with your tentacle as a natural secondary attack. The tentacle does not improve your natural reach.<br>Your tentacle deals 1d4 points of damage, and you can use your Dexterity modifier in place of your Strength modifier on attacks with your tentacle if you have the Weapon Finesse feat.<br>Additionally, you gain the improved grab special ability that you can use only with your tentacle, allowing you to initiate a grapple as a free action, without provoking attacks of opportunity, each time you hit with a tentacle attack. You can only attempt to grapple creatures within one size category of you with your tentacle.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can take this feat up to four times. Each time you do so, you gain an additional tentacle. Once you have gained all four tentacles, the lower half of your face transforms to resemble that of an illithid.<br>As a full-round action, you can give up any other attacks you have to attack with as many tentacles you possess, as described above, and can attempt to initiate a separate grapple with each tentacle as a free action. You do not gain cumulative bonuses for each tentacle already attached (as an illithid would).

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Metapsionic powers you manifest cost 2 power points less than normal (to a minimum of 1 power point) For instance, you could manifest a quickened power as power that costs only 4 more power points rather than more power points.<br>This feat has no effect on metapsionic powers that inflate the cost by only 2 power points.

        <p>Your smite attacks deal more damage to specific foes, and can damage creatures with alignment-based damage reduction.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Cha 13, smite ability.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you make a smite attack, your attack overcomes damage reduction as if had an alignment, and you deal an extra +1d6 points of damage to targets of a specific alignment.<br>If the smite attack has an alignment associated with it, it deals its extra damage to foes of that alignment and it is treated as having the opposite alignment for overcoming damage reduction. For example, a paladin&apos;s smite evil attacks are treated as having the good alignment and deal +1d6 damage to evil targets, while a blackguard&apos;s smite good attacks are treated as having the evil alignment and deal +1d6 damage to good targets.<br>If the smite attack has no alignment associated with it, you must choose an alignment component (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) when you select the feat. Your smite attacks overcome damage reduction as if they had that alignment, and deal +1d6 points of damage to foes of the opposite alignment.<br>For example, a lawful neutral cleric of St. Cuthbert with the Destruction domain who selected this feat must choose for his smite attacks to be lawfully aligned (and these attacks would deal +1d6 points of damage to chaotic targets). A lawful evil cleric of Hextor with the Destruction domain could choose to have his smite attacks be lawfully or evilly aligned (and these attacks would deal +1d6 points of damage to chaotic targets or to good targets, respectively).<br>You can&apos;t choose an alignment component that isn&apos;t part of your alignment, and once this choice is made, it can never be changed. If you later change alignment so that the chosen alignment component is no longer part of your alignment, you lose the benefits of this feat.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If you have the smite ability from more than one class, the effect of the feat applies to all your smite abilities, and it is possible to select different alignments for each (as long as the alignments chosen are legal selections). For example, a paladin/cleric with the Destruction domain must choose good for his smite good ability, but could choose law for his smite domain power.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast spells of the normal maximum spell level in at least one spellcasting class.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you select this feat, you gain one spell slot per day of any level up to one level higher than the highest level spell you can already cast in a particular class. For example, if you select this feat as a 21st-level wizard, you would gain one wizard spell slot of any spell level up to 10th. You must still have the requisite ability score (10 + spell level) to cast any spell stored in this slot. If you have a high enough ability modifier to gain one or more bonus spells for this spell level, you also gain the bonus spells for this spell level.<br>You must use the spell slot as a member of the class in which you can already cast spells of the normal maximum spell level. For instance, a 5th-level ranger/22nd-level sorcerer couldn&apos;t add a ranger spell slot, because he can&apos;t cast spells of the normal maximum spell level for rangers. He must add the spell slot to his sorcerer spells.

        <p>You are skilled at fighting while unarmed.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You are considered to be armed even when unarmed, that is, armed opponents do not get attacks of opportunity when you attack them while unarmed. However, you still get an opportunity attack against any opponent who makes an unarmed attack on you.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A monk fighting unarmed automatically gains the benefit of this feat (see page 39)<br>for Spell casters: You can use an unarmed strike to deliver a touch spell and are considered to be armed. You make a normal melee attack (the defender gets the full benefit of armor and shield). If the attack hits, the unarmed strike deals its normal damage and the spell is discharged against the defender. Only the unarmed strike can inflict a critical hit.<br>A character without this feat also could deliver a touch spell with an unarmed strike, but doing so would provoke an attack of opportunity from the target, and the unarmed strike would deal subdual damage.

            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Without this feat, you must select the Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat (or have the appropriate weapon familiarity as a racial trait) to eliminate the non-proficiency penalty you take when wielding an exotic weapon associated with your race.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As part of a whirlwind attack full-attack action, you can make all of your additional attacks based on your base attack bonus in addition to your normal attacks granted by the feat.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When using a weapon or improvised weapon, you can attempt to trip foes at range by throwing the weapon at the foe. When you attempt to do so, make a ranged touch attack with the weapon. If you hit, you and your foe make an opposed Strength check, following the normal rules for trip attempts. Your size does not count toward your Strength check.<br>The size of the weapon used might give you a bonus or a penalty. If the weapon is of a weapon size category equal to the creature size category of the foe you wish to trip, you suffer no penalty and gain no bonus. For each size category smaller the weapon is, you suffer a -4 penalty. For each size category larger the weapon is, you gain a +4 bonus. For instance, throwing a short sword (Small) at a halfling would give you no bonus or penalty. Throwing the same weapon at a human would cause you to suffer a -4 penalty, and throwing it at an ogre would cause you to suffer a -8 penalty.

This would allow her to manifest astral construct VI, with the metapsionic feat Maximize Power applied to it (11 + 6 = 17 power points) that she could not normally have manifested with the standard metapsionic cap of manifester level -1 (13 - 1 = 12 power points).

        <h1>Infusion of Balance</h1>
        <p><strong>Type</strong>: Epic
            <br><strong>Source:</strong>  Dragon #297<br></p>
        <p>You can make full use of certain magical weapons that are keyed to specific alignments, and you gain protection from similar magical attacks.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Cha 19+, neutral component of alignment
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You are infused with a balance of cosmic energies, and as a result need not fear the detrimental effects of manipulating certain magic items. You can use weapons with the following magical qualities as if you were of the most beneficial alignment: chaotic, lawful, holy, and unholy.<br>Additionally, you can avoid attacks that use chaotic, evil, good, or lawful energies through sheer force of will. If you make a successful saving throw against an attack that has any of the above descriptors (such as the <em>chaos hammer</em> spell) and that normally causes half damage on a successful save, you instead take no damage. This is an extraordinary ability.

        <h1>Inheritor</h1>
        <p><strong>Type</strong>: General
            <br><strong>Source:</strong>  Dragon #315<br></p>
        <p>You purposely expose yourself to concentrated vermeil dust, seeking to exploit its power.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Must have contracted the Red Curse, must wear and consume a vial of crimson essence (see the Crimson Essence sidebar).
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain one legacy of your choice from the Legacy Table. ( Dragon #315) To take this feat, you must wear a vial of crimson essence (see sidebar) next to your skin for one week to attune it to your own manifestations of the Red Curse. Thereafter, if you drink it at a time when you are eligible to take a new general feat, you automatically gain the Inheritor feat. At that point, you must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save. Success indicates that you permanently gain the legacy you desire and take only point of ability drain from the ability score associated with the legacy you have chosen (see the Legacy Table). Failure means you take 2 points of ability drain to the indicated ability as normal. In either case, this ability drain cannot be prevented or restored, as described under Effects of the Red Curse. If you ever become an afflicted after gaining the Inheritor feat, you are subject to double the standard ability score losses associated with the template (Dex -4, Int -4, Cha -4 instead of Dex -2, Int -2, Cha -2).
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can gain the Inheritor feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, you must choose a different legacy. Except for that restriction, its effects stack.

        <p>Your arms elongate, allowing you to touch the floor with your hands. In addition, you can bend them in strange and unnatural ways. The arms may vary in appearance, perhaps seeming scaly and snakelike, or slimy like tentacles; conversely, they may resemble normal but longer arms with a second elbow joint.

Your elongated arms also grant you a +2 bonus on Climb checks.

        <p>You have mastered a spell so thoroughly that you can now use it as a spell-like ability.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Quicken Spell, Silent Spell, Still Spell.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose any spell you can cast. You can now cast this spell at will as a spell-like ability once per round. One spell slot eight levels higher than the innate spell is permanently used to power it, and any XP cost for the innate spell is paid each time you use it. As well, you must have any focus required by the spell in order to use it as a spell-like ability, and if the innate spell has a costly material component, you must use an item worth 50 times that cost as a focus.<br>Since an innate spell is a spell-like ability and not an actual spell, a cleric can&apos;t lose it to spontaneously cast a <em>cure</em> or <em>inflict</em> spell. As well, spellcasters who become unable to cast spells of the level of the spell slot used to power the innate spell become unable to use the spell-like ability.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can choose this feat more than once, selecting another spell and paying the spell slot, focus, and material components costs each time.

        <p>You can trade the ability to manifest a power for increased power points.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Inner Strength.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Upon gaining this feat, you may choose one unassigned power and trade it in for power points. The power points gained equal the cost to manifest a power of the chosen level. For example, upon reaching 12th level, the psion takes Inner Fortitude and chooses to trade in her unassigned 5th-level power. This gives her 9 additional power points per day.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can gain this feat multiple times, each time choosing a new unassigned power to trade in for power points. You can choose to trade in only a power that has not been assigned to a power yet. You may not trade in an unassigned power that should be assigned to your primary discipline.<br>You can choose to defer selecting a power when you take this feat and instead choose a power to trade in upon gaining a level in the future. However, upon reaching 20th-level, a psion must discover powers for all unassigned power slots or use the feat to trade them in for power points. You must maintain a power reserve of 1 point per deferred Inner Fortitude feat until any unassigned powers have been selected.<br>For example a 10th-level psion has taken Inner Fortitude at levels 1, 3, 6, and 9 and has deferred them. This requires a power reserve of 4 points per day. Upon reaching 11th level, the psion cashes in all 4 deferred feats, trading in a 5th-, two 4th-, and a 3rd-level unassigned power for 28 additional power points per day. Note that the psion would have had to not assign the 4th- or 3rd-level power she gained at 9th-level.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can inscribe runes that exceed the normal limits (see Runcaster prestige class). For instance, you could inscribe a rune with a spell greater than 9th level, or a rune with a caster level greater than 20th.<br>Even this feat does not allow you to inscribe a rune with an epic spell (see Chapter 2: Epic Spells in the Epic Level Handbook).

        <p>You can create magic runes that hold spells until triggered.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Int 13, appropriate Craft skill, divine spellcaster level 3rd.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can cast any divine spell you have access to as a rune. You must have prepared the spell to be scribed and must provide any material components or focuses the spell requires. If casting the spell would reduce your XP total, you pay that cost upon beginning the rune in addition to the XP cost for making the rune itself. Likewise, material components are consumed when you begin writing the rune, but focuses are not. See Rune Magic in Chapter 2 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting for details on runes and rune magic.<br>A single object of Medium size or smaller can hold only one rune. A larger object can hold one rune per 25 square feet of surface area. Runes cannot be placed on creatures, although they can be drawn on equipment a creature carries.<br>The rune has a price equal to its spell level x caster level x 50 gp. (A 0-level spell counts as 1/2 level.) You must spend 1/25 of the price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half the price to inscribe the rune.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take this feat, it applies to a new organization.<br>The DM should limit characters to selecting only those organizations with which they have a positive or neutral relationship.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Shadow Weave Magic.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Any Weave user who employs a divination spell (such as <em>detect magic</em>), spell-like ability, or magic item that could detect the magical aura of one of your spells must make a successful level check (DC 11 + your caster level) to succeed. Similarly, a Weave user attempting to reveal the effects of one of your spells via a divination spell (such as <em>see invisibility</em>) must make a caster level check to succeed. The Weave user may check only once for each divination spell used, no matter how many of your spell effects are operating in that area.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Conjunctive Mind
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When a normal psionic creature employs a powerlike ability, or psionic item, or power (such as detect psionics) that can detect the psionic aura of one of your powers, the normal psionic creature must make a level check (DC 11 + your manifester level) to successfully detect your powers. Similarly, a normal psionic creature attempting to use a power to reveal the effects of one of your powers, such as sense psychoportation, must make a level check to reveal your power&apos;s effects. The normal psionic creature can check only once for each power used, no matter how many of your powers effects are operating in an area.<br>This benefit does not extend to powers you manifest from the Psychometabolism, Psychoportation, or Psychokinesis disciplines.<br>From now on, your ability to detect normal psionic powers is impaired. Any power you use to detect a normal psionic power is successful only if you make a level check against a DC of 9 + the manifester level. This penalty does not extend to powers from the Metacreativity, Clairsentience, and Telepathy disciplines. (You detect them normally.)

If you are sleeping and a disturbance wakes you during the night, you must make an additional save (at the same DC) to return to sleep. If you fail the Fortitude save you are fatigued when you rise in the morning. If you are fatigued when you try to sleep, you gain a +2 bonus on your save. If you are exhausted, you gain a +6 bonus.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Caster level 9th, ability to imbue a staff.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You permanently lose one of your arcane spell slots to invest an arcane spell of that level into your imbued staff. The spell invested must be one that you are able to cast and can be of a level no higher than 2 levels below the highest-level spell you can cast. Once imbued in this way, the spell chosen can be cast from the staff three times per day as a spell-like ability. Casting an invested spell in this way does not require any normal material components, but any XP cost or costly material components must still be paid. You must be in direct physical contact with your imbued staff to cast an invested spell. This feat uses a spell slot equal to the level of the spell being invested, however, you may choose to modify the spell with any metamagic feat you know and adjust the spell&apos;s level and slot accordingly. The caster level and DC for an invested spell is calculated as if you cast the spell.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: This feat maybe taken multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, select a new spell to invest. If the imbued staff is ever destroyed, the use of this ability is lost until a new staff is imbued. The ritual for preparing the staff to receive this feat requires 24 hours, and expends materials valued at 500 gp per level of the spell to be invested.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This feat expands the way you can use the Search skill by allowing you to notice and analyze available clues in a specific area. This use of the Search skill is a full-round action. Clues are pieces of evidence that lead to the solution of a mystery. Clues are physical and can be seen, heard, touched, smelled, or tasted. A clue stands out because it&apos;s not a normal feature of the area being searched. Examples of clues include a trampled flower-bed, a broken urn, a pin snapped off in a lock, a torn strip of cloak, a burnt scrap of scroll, or a brooch clutched in a dead man&apos;s fist.

        <p>You can create tiny darts of force.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast 3rd-level spells.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As long as you have a force spell of 3rd level or higher available to cast, you can use a standard action to hurl a tiny needle-shaped projectile created from pure force. This attack requires a successful ranged attack roll (not a ranged touch attack), and the dart has a range of 5 feet per level of the force spell. The needle deals 1d4 points of damage per level of the highest-level force spell you have available. Because it is composed of force, the needle can strike incorporeal creatures.<br>As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level when casting force spells.

        <p>You can channel energy directly from your deity to cause devastating damage to your enemies.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Knowledge (religion) 26 ranks, Extra Turning, ability to cast <em>gate</em>, ability to turn or rebuke creatures, ability to smite.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a full-round action, you can spend one of your turn/rebuke undead attempts to blast a single creature within 60 feet with divine energies channeled directly from your deity. The targeted creature must make a successful Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your turning class level + your Charisma modifier) or take 1d8 points of damage per two class levels. Although damage done by Invoke Divine Wrath looks like a blast of fire in a color associated with your deity, the damage itself is divine in nature and penetrates all forms of damage reduction and energy resistance.

        <p>You can make your spell effects invisible.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any metamagic feat.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can modify any spell you cast so that it carries no visual manifestation. All other aspects of the spell, including range, area, targets, and damage remain the same. Note that this feat has no bearing on any components required to cast the enhanced spell, so the spell&apos;s source might still be apparent, depending on the situation, despite its effects being unseen. For example, a fireball cast by someone with this feat could be made invisible in the moment of its detonation, but everyone in the area would still feel the full effect (including the heat), and any flammable materials ignited by the explosion would still burn visibly with nonmagical fire. Those with <em>detect magic</em>, <em>see invisibility</em>, or <em>true seeing</em> spells or effects active at the time of the casting will see whatever visual manifestations typically accompany the spell.</p><p>A spell modified using the Invisible Spell feat uses a spell slot of the spell&apos;s normal level.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Dex 13, Combat Expertise, Dodge.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent that hits you in melee. On your action, you choose to take a -4 penalty to your Armor Class in exchange for the ability to make an attack of opportunity against any creature that makes a successful melee attack or melee touch attack against you. The opponent that hits you must be in your threatened area, and this feat does not grant you more attacks of opportunity than you are normally allowed in a round. You specify on your turn that you are activating this feat, and the change to your Armor Class and your ability to make these special attacks of opportunity last until your next turn.

When you use Ki Barrage, a glowing, white fist (or foot, or head, or whatever body part you typically make unarmed attacks with) made entirely of force appears. It functions as a thrown ranged weapon with a range increment of 30 feet. The effect lasts round.<br>The glowing fist attacks the target or targets you designate. It uses your base attack bonus for unarmed strikes (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round) with any modifiers that normally apply to your ranged attacks. If multiple attacks per round are permitted, you can allocate them as desired against opponents within range. For example, a 10th-level monk can make three attacks with a single use of Ki Barrage and allocate them against up to three targets. The base attack bonus is +7 for the first attack, +4 for the second, and +1 for the third.<br>Each successful attack deals damage as if you had hit the target with a successful unarmed strike, including all bonuses that would apply for such a blow. You must declare that you are using the feat before making any attack rolls. Whether or not any of the attacks hit, the attempt expends one daily use of the stunning fist ability.<br>Attacks made with this feat cannot be also be enhanced by any other unarmed attack feat or class feature (such as stunning fist or flurry of blows), or by the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, or by any feats or special abilities that affect ranged attacks (such as Rapid Shot).

The <em>ki</em> orb is a force effect.<br>If you fail to throw the orb before the end of your turn, it dissipates harmlessly.<br>When you take this feat, you gain an additional daily use of Stunning Fist.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A fighter can select Ki Blast as one of his fighter bonus feats.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain a supernatural ability to sense and understand laws. Add your paladin level to any Knowledge or Intelligence check made regarding laws. You can use this ability even if you are unfamiliar with the local laws or don&apos;t even know where you are. For example, if you use this ability upon approaching the city of Luthcheq in Chessenta, a Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (local Chessenta) check reveals to you that arcane magic is forbidden there. If you later end up in a strange land by way of a portal, and a Knowledge (religion) check reveals that Loviatar is the official religion where you are, you realize you are in (for instance) Dambrath. You can use this ability to find loopholes in the law, such as learning that the local temple&apos;s ability to offer a wanted criminal sanctuary only applies from dusk until dawn, allowing you to arrest the criminal after daybreak.<br>When you use your detect evil ability, the second round of use reveals whether or not any creatures in the area are devils, though you do not learn their exact location (but in most cases you can identify them in the third round by the strength of their aura).<br>You gain a +1 sacred bonus to Armor Class against devils.

        <p>Your military order is dedicated to fighting Set and his minions, and even death cannot stop you from this task.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Paladin or ranger 8th, patron deity Osiris.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You get a +4 sacred bonus on saving throws against death effects, energy drain, and ability drain.<br>If you are slain by a follower of Set, you come back to life 1 hour later as though <em>resurrection</em> had been cast upon you. Instead of losing a level due to this effect, you gain one negative level.<br>If a follower of Osiris brings you back to life with <em>raise dead, resurrection</em>, or a similar effect that would normally cause you to lose a level, you gain one negative level rather than losing a level.<br>You can gain the negative level bestowed by this feat even if you are normally immune to negative levels. A negative level bestowed by this feat can&apos;t be removed by any normal means (such as <em>restoration</em>), nor does it ever become an actual lost level. Instead, the negative level remains until you next gain a class level, or until you kill or destroy the follower of Set who killed you, at which point it disappears. While you have a negative level bestowed by this feat, you lose all benefits of this feat except the sacred bonus on saving throws.

        <p>By putting your bulk behind a blow, you can push your enemy backward.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Improved Bull Rush, Power Attack, size Large or larger (goliaths qualify by virtue of their powerful build racial trait).
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: If you score a hit while you are using the Power Attack feat, you can make a free bull rush attempt against the foe you hit, applying the number by which you reduced your attack roll as a bonus on the opposed Strength check (as well as on the damage you deal). If you hit with a two-handed weapon, you can apply double that number on the opposed Strength check. Unlike standard bull rush attempts, knockback attempts don&apos;t provoke attacks of opportunity, and you don&apos;t move with the enemy you knock backward. Bull rush rules can be found on page 154 of the <strong><em>Player&apos;s Handbook</em></strong>.

        <p>You can manifest powers that knock creatures off their feet.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. Knockdown Power knocks any creature caught in its area prone if the target fails its saving throw to avoid any or all of the damage of the power. It can only be applied to powers that allow Reflex saves and affect an area (a cone, line, burst, and so on). Powers that do not allow saving throws gain no advantage if they are made into knockdown powers. Creatures with evasion are knocked prone if they fail their Reflex saves (creatures with improved evasion are not knocked down if they fail their saves). Flying creatures affected by a knockdown power that fail their saving throws are forced down 10 feet.<br>For example, if a creature makes its saving throw against a knockdown energy cone but still takes half damage, it is not knocked prone. If it fails its save and takes full damage, it is knocked prone. Using this feat increases the power point cost by 2. The power&apos;s total power point cost cannot exceed your manifester level.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Knowledge (any) 5 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Upon selecting this feat, you immediately add one Knowledge skill of your choice to your list of class skills. Thereafter, you treat that skill as a class skill, regardless of which class you are advancing in. Whenever you fight a creature, you can make a Knowledge check based on its type, provided that you have at least one rank in the appropriate Knowledge skill.<br>You then receive an insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against that creature type for the remainder of the combat. The amount of the bonus depends on your Knowledge check result, as given on the following table.</p><table class="table" style="width:30em"><tr><td>Check Result</td><td>BonusGranted</td></tr><tr><td>15 or below</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>16-25</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>26-30</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>31-35</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>36 or higher</td><td>+5</td></tr></table><p>You can make only one Knowledge check per creature type per combat. If you fight creatures of multiple types during the same combat, you can make one Knowledge check per type, thereby possibly gaining different bonuses against different opponents.<br>This benefit is an extraordinary ability.

Creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits or sneak attacks are not subject to this extra damage. Any creature with concealment is immune to this extra damage.

Also, you can sleep in medium armor without becoming fatigued.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A kobold who would gain Endurance as a bonus feat can choose Kobold Endurance in its place. Kobold Endurance counts as the Endurance feat for the purpose of meeting a prerequisite for a feat, prestige class, or special ability.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: By reducing your sneak attack damage by three damage dice, you can make a melee attack that causes your target to lose the use of one of his hands (your choice) for 1 minute. Your target can make a Fortitude save to resist (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + damage dealt). If he fails the save he drops whatever he is holding in that hand, cannot use two-handed weapons, and he may not engage in any action that requires the use of both hands (such as using the Climb or Use Rope skills).

For every two hit points so sacrificed, you gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls for i round.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Kuo-toa, flurry of blows.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a swift action, a kuo-toa can smear a strange, sticky substance on its hands. When using flurry of blows, the kuo-toa automatically hits with one of its extra attacks if its first attack hits.

        <p>By knowing the right nobles, making contacts with masons and artisans, or performing great deeds for a liege-lord, you have resources that help you build and expand your stronghold.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: The character must be at least 9th level.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This feat gives you a small allowance that you can use to build or expand a stronghold. It&apos;s not cash, so it only applies to stronghold purchases. (You can&apos;t cash it out and spend it on something else.)<br>In addition, the feat provides matching funds for expenditures made from your own purse of gold. For example, if you spend 50,000 gp of your own (beyond the allowance) to purchase stronghold components, walls, or wondrous architecture, the feat provides a bonus allowance of the same amount.<br>The exact nature of the resources depends on your campaign; you and your DM should decide on this beforehand. If you have performed missions successfully for a noble, rich merchant, or other power group, perhaps they have willed the land to you. If you&apos;re a cleric, maybe the church sends supplicants to provide free labor. Regardless of your class or social standing, you might inherit a keep from a long-lost relative.<br>See Landlord Funds (below) for how much you can spend. When you first select the Landlord feat, you receive the amount listed under stronghold Allowance. At each successive level, you get an additional allowance equal to the amount listed under Additional Funds Gained (which is equal to the difference between the stronghold Allowance of your new level and the previous level). For example, if you take the Landlord feat at 9th level, you get 25,000 gp to spend on a stronghold. When you attain 10th level, you receive an additional 25,000 gp (50,000 - 25,000) to spend on your stronghold. Characters can save their allowance from level to level if they wish.<br><strong>Note</strong>: Multiple characters can purchase this feat and pool their resources to construct a stronghold together. However, the feat only provides matching funds for your own contributions (that is, if one character from a to group of four contributes 10,000 gp to the construction of the group&apos;s stronghold, the feat provides matching funds for that character (10,000 gp), not for all four characters (40,000 gp), even if all four have the feat). If all four characters have the feat and each contributes funds to the cause, they each receive matching funds equal to their contribution.</p><table class="table" style="width:30em"><tr><th colspan="3">Landlord Funds</th></tr><tr><td>Level</td><td>Stronghold Allowance</td><td>Additional Funds Gained</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>25,000 gp</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>50,000 gp</td><td>25,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Ii</td><td>75,000 gp</td><td>25,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>100,000 gp</td><td>25,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>150,000 gp</td><td>50,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>200,000 gp</td><td>50,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>250,000 gp</td><td>50,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>300,000 gp</td><td>50,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>400,000 gp</td><td>100,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>500,000 gp</td><td>100,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>600,000 gp</td><td>100,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>800,000 gp</td><td>200,000 gp</td></tr></table><p>

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Breath weapon
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Each use of your breath weapon lingers until the creature&apos;s next turn, and those entering or staying within the area of effect on the second round may take damage (see below). Those using Lingering Breath must decide before breathing that they are using the feat, otherwise the breath weapon acts as normal. Damage done in the second round is reduced by half. For example, a great red wyrm can normally breathe a cone of fire every 1d4+1 rounds doing 24d10 damage. A great red wyrm with the Lingering Breath feat can breath a cone of fire every 1d4+1 rounds that lasts 2 rounds,doing 24d10 damage the first round and 12d10 damage the second round.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Con 15, breath weapon, Clinging Breath.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your breath weapon has its normal effects, but also remains as a lingering cloud of the same shape and size as the original breath weapon. This cloud lasts 1 round.<br>Foes caught in the breath weapon&apos;s area when you breathe take no additional damage from the lingering breath weapon, provided they leave the cloud by the shortest available route on their next turn. Otherwise, anyone who touches or enters the cloud while it lasts takes one-half of the breath weapon&apos;s normal effects; any saving throw the breath weapon normally allows still applies. Damaging breath weapons deal one-half their normal damage, and breath weapons with effects that have durations last for half the normal time. If a creature is affected by the same non-damaging breath weapon twice, the effects do not stack.<br>For example, an old silver dragon uses this feat on its cold breath weapon. Creatures caught in the 50-foot cone take 16d8 points of cold damage, and a DC 31 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The 50-foot cone lingers for 1 round. While the cone lasts, anyone touching or entering it takes 8d8 points of cold damage, and a DC 31 Reflex save reduces the cold damage to 4d8 points. Creatures in the cone when the dragon breathed take no additional damage if they leave by the shortest available route on their next turn.<br>If the same dragon uses this feat on its paralyzing breath weapon, a creature caught in the 50-foot cone must make a DC 31 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d6+8 rounds. The 50-foot cone lingers for 1 round. While the cone lasts, anyone touching or entering it must make a DC 31 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d3+4 rounds. Creatures in the cone when the dragon breathed take no additional damage if they leave by the shortest available route on their next turn. Creatures paralyzed by the initial breath cannot leave the cloud, but suffer no additional effects because the paralyzing effects do not stack.<br>When you use this feat, add +2 to the number of rounds you must wait before using your breath weapon again.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can apply this feat more than once to the same breath weapon. Each time you do, the lingering breath lasts an additional round.<br>You can apply this feat to a breath weapon that also has received the Clinging Breath feat, but the resulting breath clings only to foes caught in the initial breath.

After the spell is cast, lingering tendrils of energy persist, dealing 1d6 points of damage of the appropriate energy type at the beginning of your next turn to all creatures initially damaged by the spell. The spell is considered to be in effect during this time and can be dispelled normally. A lingering spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

        <h1>Linked Power</h1>

        <p>You can link a power to the power you manifest in this round so that it goes off next round.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. Manifesting a power altered by this feat means that you must choose two powers - one you intend to manifest in this round, and one you intend to manifest in the next round. The power that is manifested in this round is not altered in any way, nor is the linked power that goes off in the next round - however, you do not need to spend any of your actions or power points next round to manifest the linked power.<br>The linked power is automatically targeted on the same area or target as the power you manifest in this round (if the power you manifest this round has no area or target, choose an area or target in this round for the linked power to affect in the next round). If the same creature is targeted by both powers, the target experiences all the effects of both powers individually and receives a saving throw (if applicable) for each. In some cases, such as a psionic charm followed by a linked psionic charm, failing both saving throws results in redundant effects (although, in this example, any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel attempts to free the target from the charm effect).<br> It is possible that by the time the linked power comes into effect on the following round, the area where it goes off or the target that it affects no longer has relevance. On the other hand, you are free on the subsequent round to take actions normally.<br>Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power manifested this round by a number equal to the power point cost of the linked power. Thus if you manifest energy stun (3 power points) and energy burst (S power points) as the linked power, the metapsionic cost is 8. The total of power points you spend in this manner cannot exceed your manifester level.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The Mad Alchemist feat grants you access to three special tactical maneuvers.<br><em>Distracting Blast</em>: If you ready an action to throw a thunderstone at the square an opponent occupies, you can disrupt his actions. The sudden bang from the stone&apos;s detonation ruins your foe&apos;s concentration, possibly spoiling his attack or his attempt to cast a spell. If the target of this blast was casting a spell when you threw the thunderstone, he must make a Concentration check opposed by your Craft (alchemy) check. If you succeed on this check, his spell is ruined. If the target was not casting a spell, he must make a Will save opposed by your Craft (alchemy) check or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, checks, and saves until the beginning of your next turn.<br><em>Fiery Blaze</em>: To use this maneuver, you must first strike a creature with a container of lantern oil or alchemist&apos;s fire. On your next turn, you must strike the creature with a spell or weapon attack that deals fire damage. If you do so, the creature takes an extra 1d6 points of fire damage and catches on fire if it is not already in flames.<br><em>Tanglefoot Defense</em>: By tearing open a tanglefoot bag and spreading its contents across an area, you can create a vexing barrier that hinders an opponent&apos;s approach. As a standard action, you can transform a single square of clear terrain into difficult terrain through the use of a tanglefoot bag. This effect persists for 10 minutes before the tanglefoot bag loses its potency.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When in a natural setting, you can draw on the power of the land to imbue your spells with healing power. For the purpose of this feat, a natural setting is defined as any location not within a community and not a constructed area. Natural setting* includes unworked caverns, but not crafted dungeons and the like.<br>To use the feat, you must succeed on a Knowledge (nature) check (DC 15 + spell level), made as a free action while casting a spell. You can&apos;t take 10 on this check. If you succeed, each target of your spell is healed of 2 points of damage per spell level, in addition to the spell&apos;s normal effects. If the spell doesn&apos;t have a target entry, this feat has no effect. This healing power is positive energy, so an undead creature instead takes 2 points of damage per spell level. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save (at the spell&apos;s normal save DC) to negate this effect. If the skill check fails, the prepared spell or spell slot is lost.<br>You cannot use this feat on any spell with an alignment descriptor, nor with any necromancy spell. The natural world favors balance in all things, and thus does not support specific alignment-based magic, nor can its life-giving power be used to enhance the magic of death.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You must use one spell slot of your highest spell level to cast or prepare a spell of a lower level. This spell slot may be used to cast or prepare any spell of any level lower than your highest level, effectively causing you to lose one of your highest-level spell slots to gain one of a lower level. For example, a 6th-level sorcerer would lose the ability to cast one 3rd-level spell per day, but would gain the ability to cast one additional 0, 1st-, or 2nd-level spell instead. This flaw always affects your highest spell level and changes the spell level it affects as you gain levels.

        <h1>Martial Throw</h1>
        <p><strong>Type</strong>: General, Fighter

        <p>You can switch positions with an opponent you hit in melee by throwing that opponent.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Dex 17, Improved Unarmed Strike.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you are adjacent to an opponent of your size category or smaller and you hit that opponent with an unarmed strike, you may immediately make a special opposed grapple check against that opponent. Make a grapple check using your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier. The opponent uses its Strength modifier as normal. If you succeed, you and your opponent are not grappling, but you switch positions with the foe. (If either combatant occupies more than one square, both must end up adjacent to each other after the throw, each must occupy at least one square the other formerly occupied, and neither can be located in a square occupied by any obstacle or other creature. If both combatants can&apos;t meet these conditions, you can&apos;t execute the throw.)<br>Switching positions in this fashion does not provoke attacks of opportunity.<br>You can use this feat on allies as well as enemies, if the other character is willing, your attack roll and grapple check are automatically successful, and you deal unarmed strike damage to your ally normally. (This move is a hard, violent throw, and you can&apos;t pull it off without actually striking the subject of the throw.)<br>This feat can be used only once per round.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A fighter may select this feat as one of his fighter bonus feats.

        <p>Choose a type of martial weapon, such as longbow (see Table 74: Weapons, pages 98-99, for a list of martial weapons). You understand how to use that type of martial weapon in combat. Use this feat to expand the list of weapons you are proficient with beyond the basic list in the class description.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You make attack rolls with the weapon normally
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient with all martial weapons. You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new weapon. A cleric whose deity&apos;s favored weapon is a martial weapon and who chooses War as one of his domains receives the Martial Weapon Proficiency feat related to that weapon for free, as well as the Weapon Focus feat related to that weapon. A sorcerer or wizard who casts the spell <em>Tenser&apos;s transformation</em> on herself gains proficiency with all martial weapons for the duration of the spell.

        <p><strong>Type</strong>: General
            <br><strong>Source:</strong>  Dragon #350<br></p>
        <p>You craft masterwork bows and arrows with remarkable skill and speed.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Craft (bowyer) 6 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your exceptional skill as a bowyer and fletcher allows you to fashion masterwork bows and arrows at half the normal cost and in half the normal time.

        <p>You can learn one additional power from your primary discipline.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Extra Power, Manifester level 3rd+.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You learn one additional power at any level up to the highest-level power you can manifest. For example, a 12th-level psion character can learn a new power from 0 level to 6th level.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you gain the feat, you learn a new power at any level up to the highest-level power you can manifest.

        <p>You temporarily gain access to legacy abilities beyond your normal reach.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Channel Legacy, Least Legacy, Use Magic Device 4 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per day as a free action, you can treat your character level as if it were one higher for determining which legacy abilities you can use. You do not pay any new personal costs associated with the increased level, but you cannot access any abilities for which you have not met the prerequisites. For example, a 10th-level character gains no benefit from this feat, since she has not yet gained the Lesser Legacy feat required to use legacy abilities of 11th level or higher.<br>This effect lasts for 1 hour or until you activate a legacy ability with a daily use limit, whichever comes first.

        <p>Your words are your weapons. You confuse others with your speech, luring them into giving up vital secrets and leaving them dumbfounded with your carefully constructed, conversational static.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Cha 13, Diplomacy 9 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This feat grants two new uses for the Diplomacy skill. You must share a language with a creature to use these options against it. Neither ability functions during combat.<br><em>Captivating Speech</em>: You can distract a creature with your compelling delivery and witticisms. With a successful Diplomacy check opposed by the target&apos;s own Diplomacy check or Will save, you can impose a -4 penalty on the target&apos;s listen, Sense Motive, and Spot checks so long as you continue speaking. You can affect a number of targets equal to 1 + your Cha bonus (if any), as long as they are all within 20 feet.<br><em>Trap of Words</em>: If a creature attempts and fails to successfully to use Bluff to lie to you, you skillfully maneuver the conversation to confuse the target or trick him into letting slip a vital clue. After succeeding on your Sense Motive check, you can then engage the target in conversation for at least 1 minute. At the end of this time, make a Diplomacy check opposed by the target&apos;s Bluff check. If you succeed, the target inadvertently reveals his lie and the reason behind it.

        <p>You are highly trained and adept in the use of toxic substances.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can apply poison or oil to a weapon as a swift action, without provoking attacks of opportunity. In addition, you never risk accidentally poisoning yourself when applying poison to a weapon.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Applying poison or oil to a weapon is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. When applying poison to a weapon, you have a 5% chance of accidentally poisoning yourself.

        <p>You gain extra uses of your drow powers of light and darkness.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Drow
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain one extra daily use of each of your drow spell-like abilities (<i>dancing lights</i>, <i>darkness</i>, and <i>faerie fire</i>).<br>In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to your caster level with these spell-like abilities.

        <p>You can control an undead that you create... for a time.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Knowledge (religion) 5 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you create an undead creature, you can decide that it doesn&apos;t count against your normal limit of controlled undead creatures. In this case, you still control the creature, but only for a number of days equal to your caster level. When this duration ends, the undead immediately becomes hostile to you (though you can establish control over it by other means). You can have only one creature of this kind at a time.

        <p>Your arcane studies allow you to mingle arcane magic of different flavors for great effect.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast 2nd-level arcane spells, steal spell.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your spellthief levels stack with levels of other arcane spellcaster classes (that is, levels of any class that grants arcane spellcasting other than the spellthief) for the purpose of determining what level of spell you can steal. For example, a 4th-level spellthief/4th-level wizard could steal spells of up to 4th level, as if he were an 8th-level spellthief.<br>Your spellthief and arcane spellcaster levels also stack when determining your caster level for all arcane spells. The character described above would have a caster level of 8th for both his spellthief spells and his wizard spells.<br>In addition, you do not incur a chance of arcane spell failure for arcane spells cast or stolen from other classes, but only if you are wearing light armor. You incur the normal arcane spell failure chance when wearing medium or heavy armor or when using a shield.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A spellthief does not incur a chance of arcane spell failure when casting spellthief spells in light armor. He incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for other arcane spells he casts, including those stolen from arcane casters.

        <h1>Master Staff</h1>
        <p><strong>Type</strong>: Epic

        <p>You can activate a staff without using a charge.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Craft Staff, Spellcraft 15 ranks
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you activate a staff, you can substitute a spell slot instead of using a charge. The spell slot must be one you have not used for the day, though you may lose a prepared spell to emulate a wand charge (you may not lose prepared spells from your school of specialty, if any). The spell slot lost must be equal to or higher in level than the specific spell stored in the staff, including any level increasing metamagic enhancements. You cannot emulate a charge for a staff function that does not match a specific spell. For example, you might want to save the charges on your staff of power because you do not want to go to the trouble of crafting another when the charges run out, and also because it allows you more options - you can memorize more utilitarian spells, trusting to the offensive power of your staff if conflict arises. You can use this feat to lose a 3rd-level prepared slot in order to active <em>lightning bolt</em> from the staff, but you can&apos;t use this feat to emulate a charge used for doubling the staff&apos;s melee damage (because that power doesn&apos;t match a specific spell).

        <p>You can swim while heavily laden with a reduced risk of drowning.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Str 15, Athletic
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When using the Swim skill while wearing armor, you only take the normal armor check penalty and encumbrance penalty on your Swim check.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Swim checks are subject to double the normal armor check penalty and encumbrance penalty. 
            <br></p>

        <p>You can activate a wand without using a charge.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Craft Wand, Spellcraft 15 ranks
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you activate a wand, you can substitute a spell slot instead of using a charge. The spell slot must be one you have not used for the day, though you may lose a prepared spell to emulate a wand charge (you may not lose prepared spells from your school of specialty, any). The spell slot lost must be equal to or higher in level than the spell stored in the wand, including any level increasing metamagic enhancements. For example, if <em>lightning bolt</em> is on your class list and you find a wand of lightning bolt with 3 charges, you can expend unused spell slots instead of charges, thus extending life of the wand.

        <p><strong>Type</strong>: General
            <br><strong>Source:</strong>  Dragon #304<br></p>
        <p>You have fought on many planes and visited countless civilizations, learning their ways of combat and studying their martial arts. When presented with a strange weapon, you readily master its use.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Member of the Nameless Legion, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (any).
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You suffer a -2 penalty rather than the normal -4 when fighting with a weapon for which you do not possess proficiency.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If you are no longer a member of the Nameless Legion, you do not lose access to this feat.

            <br><strong>Source:</strong>  Dragon #333<br></p>
        <p>A genius of repartee and quick-witted insults, you can provoke your opponents to leave them too furious to worry about their own safety.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Perform (comedy) 8 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You may, as a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, attempt to enrage a single melee opponent by making a Perform (comedy) check. The result of this check represents the DC of the Will save your opponent must make to avoid becoming enraged. Enraged opponents attack you whenever able, ignoring all other targets. They gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls against you but take a -2 penalty to Armor Class. This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent effect.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A fighter may select Master of Mockery as one of his fighter bonus feats.

        <p>The tutelage of your long-vanished homeland allows you to mimic the magical aura of others, including the creators of certain magical creatures.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Use Magic Device 9 ranks, Wedded to History, golden ager background
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You may, as a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, attempt to impersonate the master or creator of a non-intelligent creature of the undead or construct type. This requires you to make a Use Magic Device check (DC 20 +HD of creature). If you succeed in tricking the creature you may then, as a standard action, command it to perform any task it is normally capable of performing, so long as you succeed in another Use Magic Device check (DC = 10+HD of creature). You must make this check each round in which it performs the commanded action, and if you should ever fail a check, you much reestablish your false personal prior to issuing a new command. 
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: The creature always recognizes its true master, making it impossible for you to control it when in his presence.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You may only use spell-trigger items (wands and staffs) that cast spells on your domain spell lists. Other spell-trigger items fail in your hands.

        <p>You absorb an eyestalk into your body and sprout it anew within your mouth.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Beholder.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one eye ray to move permanently to your mouth. You may use this ray in two different ways each round. If you hit an opponent with your bite attack, the ray from the eyestalk in your mouth automatically strikes that foe as well. You may also open your mouth to fire this ray, but its use is limited to your forward arc. Whichever way you choose to utilize this eye ray, it counts against the number of eye rays that you can fire into your forward arc. You can only use this ray once per round.

        <p>You can cast mysteries to maximum effect.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any two metashadow feats.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per day, all variable, numeric effects of a mystery modified by this feat are maximized. This functions in most respects as the Maximize Spell feat.<br>Casting a maximized mystery is a full-round action.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can take this feat up to four times. To take it a second time, you must have five metashadow feats. To take it a third time, you must have eight metashadow feats. To take it a fourth time, you must have eleven metashadow feats.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Con 17, breath weapon.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: If you use your breath weapon as a full-round action, all variable, numeric effects of the attack are maximized. A maximized breath weapon deals maximum damage, lasts for the maximum time, or the like. For example, an old silver dragon using a maximized cold breath weapon (damage 16d8) deals 128 points of damage. An old silver dragon using a maximized paralysis gas breath weapon (duration 1d6+8 rounds) paralyzes creatures for 14 rounds if they fail their saving throws.<br>The DCs for saving throws against your breath weapon are not affected.<br>When you use this feat, add +3 to the number of rounds you must wait before using your breath weapon again.<br>This feat stacks with the effects of breath weapons enhanced with other metabreath feats, but does not maximize them. For example, a maximized breath weapon further enhanced by the Tempest Breath feat produces the type of wind effect noted in that feat description, but the velocity of the wind is not also maximized.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You cannot use this feat and the Quicken Breath feat on the same breath weapon at the same time.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see <a href="../../charbuild/skills/concentration.shtml#psionics">Concentration skill</a> description). You can maximize a power. All variable, numeric effects of a power modified by this feat are maximized. A maximized power deals maximum damage, cures the maximum number of hit points, affects the maximum number of targets, and so on, as appropriate. Saving throws and opposed checks are not affected, nor are powers without random variables.<br>Augmented powers can be maximized; a maximized augmented power deals the maximum damage (or cures the maximum hit points, and so on) of the augmented power.<br>An empowered and maximized power gains the separate benefits of each feat: the maximum result plus one-half the normally rolled result.<br>Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 4.

        <p>You can use a spell-like ability at its maximum effect.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spell-like ability at caster level 6th or higher.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one of your spell-like abilities (subject to the restrictions below) to use at maximum effectiveness up to three times per day (or the ability&apos;s normal use limit, whichever is less). All variable, numeric effects of the spell-like ability are maximized, dealing maximum damage, curing the maximum number of hit points, affecting the maximum number of targets, and so on. For example, a 10th-level warlock&apos;s maximized eldritch blast deals 36 points of damage three times per day. Saving throws and opposed checks (such as the one you make when you cast dispel magic) are not affected, nor are spell-like abilities without random variables.<br>An empowered maximized spell-like ability gains the benefit of each feat separately (getting the maximum result plus one-half the normally rolled result). For example, a fire mephit&apos;s empowered maximized scorching ray would deal 24 points of damage plus one-half of 4d6 points of damage.<br>The spell-like ability you wish to maximize can be chosen only from those abilities that duplicate a spell of a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down), minus 2. For a summary, see the Caster level to Empower column in the table on page 304 of the <strong><em>Monster Manual</em></strong>.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time, you apply it to a different one of your spell-like abilities.

        <p>You can cast spells to maximum effect.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: All variable, numeric effects of a maximized spell are maximized. A maximized spell deals maximum damage, cures the maximum number of hit points, affects the maximum number of targets, etc., as appropriate. For example, a maximized fireball deals 6 points of damage per caster level (up to 60 points of damage). Saving throws and opposed rolls (such as the one you make when you cast dispel magic) are not affected. Spells without random variables are not affected. A maximized spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell&apos;s actual level. An empowered, maximized spell gains the separate benefits of each feat: the maximum result plus one-half the normally rolled result.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you spontaneously cast an arcane spell that is enhanced by a metamagic feat, you can spend a number of uses of your bardic music ability equal to the number of extra levels that the metamagic feat imposes on the spell rather than raising the spell&apos;s effective level.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any metamagic feat, Use Magic Device 15 ranks or Spellcraft 15 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can apply any one metamagic feat you know to a spell generated by a spell trigger item (such as a wand or staff) that you activate. You expend one extra charge for each change in spell level a metamagic feat normally requires.<br>If the metamagic feat&apos;s level adjustment would normally increase the slot of the chosen spell&apos;s level above 9th, you can&apos;t apply the metamagic effect to the spell. For example, you can&apos;t apply Quicken Spell to an antimagicfield generated by a staff (since that would take a 10th-level spell slot to cast).<br>If sufficient charges aren&apos;t available in the item to power the application of metamagic feats (or if the item doesn&apos;t use charges), the item fails to activate and no charges are used, but the action used to activate the item is wasted.

(You are still subject to other restrictions on the use of the ability.) For example, after you use a dragon&apos;s breath weapon, you can&apos;t use it again for 1d4 rounds.) The save DC to resist supernatural ability gained through Metamorphic Transfer (if it is an attack) is 10 + your Cha modifier + 1/2 your Hit Dice.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you can gain one additional supernatural ability.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: You cannot use the supernatural abilities of creatures whose form you assume.

        <h1>Metanode Spell</h1>
        <p><strong>Type</strong>: Metamagic

        <p>You cast metamagic spells to greater effect in nodes to which you are attuned than elsewhere.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Node Spellcasting, caster level 1st.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When casting a spell improved by a metamagic feat, you can deduct the class of the node layer in which you currently stand from the increased spell level. The class of the layer does not equal the class of the node unless you are standing in the innermost portion of it.<br>For example, if you use Maximize Spell to augment the 5th-level spell <em>flame strike</em> in the innermost (+1) layer of a Class 1 node, you cast the spell as if it were only two levels higher than normal, not three, because the node pays one spell level&apos;s worth of the metamagic cost. This feat is most useful to casters who do not prepare spells (such as bards and sorcerers) and to wizards who rarely leave their nodes and can therefore prepare and cast their spells at the adjusted level.<br>If you use this feat to reduce the cost of preparing a metamagic spell and then leave the node, the spell you prepared is unavailable until you return to a node layer of at least the same class as the one in which the spell was prepared.

        <p>You can permanently modify a psionic power you know with a metapsionic feat.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to manifest psionic powers, any other metapsionic feat.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You choose one power known to you to become permanently modified by one metapsionic feat you know. The cost of modifying your chosen power with metapsionic feats is reduced by 2 power points (to a minimum extra cost of 0 power points). When you manifest the modified power with that metapsionic feat, you must still obey any restrictions of that feat (for example, expending your psionic focus). Once a metapower is created by taking this feat it cannot be changed. The metapower can be used normally with other metapsionic feats you know.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you choose a power - either one you have already modified or another power you know - and reduce the metapsionic feat cost of that power by 2 power points for a different specific metapsionic feat.

        <p>A beholder with this feat can apply the effects of metamagic feats to its eye rays.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: True beholder or beholderkin, at least one metamagic feat.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per round, as a standard action, the creature can enhance one of its eye rays with the effect of a metamagic feat that it possesses. Enhancing an eye ray in this manner burns the eyestalk out for a number of rounds equal to the amount by which the metamagic would normally increase a spell level. Since firing an eye ray that hasn&apos;t been enhanced with metamagic is a free action, the creature still can use its other eye rays in a round in which it enhances one ray with metamagic.<br>For example, if a beholder had the Maximize Spell feat and the Metaray feat, it could take a standard action to fire a maximized inflict moderate wounds eye ray that would cause 26 points of damage on a hit. Its inflict moderate wounds eyestalk would then not be usable for the next 3 rounds.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: The creature cannot use this ability with a metamagic feat that would increase the level of a spell by more than three levels.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per day, you can invest essentia into this feat and choose one or more spells that you know (and have prepared, if you prepare spells) to apply the effect of a metamagic feat that you know. Each spell to be affected requires the investment of a number of essentia equal to the normal spell level adjustment required by the metamagic feat (minimum 1 point of essentia). The next time you cast that spell, the spell gains the effect of that metamagic feat without any change to its level (or casting time, if you cast spells spontaneously).<br>You can apply the effect of this feat to as many spells as you can afford to invest with essentia. You can apply the effect of different metamagic feats to different spells, as long as you know all metamagic feats applied and you have sufficient essentia capacity to do so. For example, you could invest 1 point of essentia to enlarge a spell (as Enlarge Spell) and 2 points of essentia to empower a spell (as Empower Spell), as long as you had at least 3 points of essentia to invest, had an essentia capacity (see Table 2-1 <strong>Magic of Incarnum</strong>: Essentia Capacity) of 3 or greater, and knew both the Empower Spell and Enlarge Spell feats.<br>Once essentia is invested in a spell, it remains invested until the spell is cast, at which point the essentia returns to your essentia pool.<br>You gain 1 point of essentia.

        <p>You may use the power of your mind to form a shield as well as a blade.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to form a +1 mind blade, shape mind blade ability.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can split your mind blade into a mind blade and a mind shield. The blade is your standard mind blade with an enhancement bonus 1 lower than you would otherwise create, as usual for splitting your mind blade. The mind shield has all the statistics of a light shield (including armor check penalty), with an enhancement bonus 1 lower than you would create as a single mind blade. If you shield bash with your mind shield it counts as a magic weapon, but it does not gain the benefits from your mind blade enhancement bonus or special abilities.<br>A mind shield has hardness and hit points equal to your mind blade.

        <p>When you use your psychic strike ability, you deal more damage.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to generate a mind blade, psychic strike +1d8.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: If you expend your psionic focus when you imbue your mind blade with a psychic strike, the destructive energy instilled in your blade deals one more die of damage. For example, when a 7th-level soulknife charges his blade with a psychic strike in conjunction with expending his psionic focus, the damage potential of the blade is +3d8 points (instead of +2d8 points).

        <p>The mental power of your ancestors has passed to you.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Illithid Bloodline, ability to cast 2nd-level arcane spells.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can use <em>daze</em> three times per day as a spell-like ability (caster level equals your level in the arcane spellcasting class that granted you access to this feat). This ability does not affect your number of spells known or spells per day.

        <p>A creature that has this feat possesses innate telepathic ability that allows it to precisely pinpoint other thinking beings within range of its telepathy. The creature perceives where the others are and how powerful their intellects are.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Telepathy special quality.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: A creature that has this feat can detect and pinpoint beings that are not mindless (anything with an Intelligence score of 1 or higher) within range of its telepathy. This works much like blindsense - the creature knows what square each thinking being is in, but it does not see the being, and the being still has total concealment unless the creature can see it by some other means.<br>The creature also perceives several observable characteristics about each being detected with mindsight, including the being&apos;s type and Intelligence score. The creature need not take any additional or special actions to gain this information; it is as obvious to mindsight as the being&apos;s race and clothing would be to eyesight.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Telepathy offers no special ability to sense other minds. The creature has to know that a being is there to communicate with it telepathically.

        <p>You can cast orisons.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Charisma 13, Divine Channeler, patron deity
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Upon taking this feat, you gain knowledge of four orisons of your choice from the cleric spell list. Each day, you can cast three of these spells, in any combination, without preparing them, in the same manner as a sorcerer knows and casts spells. The save DC (if any) for each such spell is 10 + your Charisma modifier. Your caster level for these spells is one-half your character level.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can take this feat multiple times, gaining one extra orison known and one extra spell slot per day each time. However, you cannot know more than seven orisons or cast more than six orisons per day by virtue of this feat. <br>Minor Divine Spellcaster does not affect and is not affected by the spellcasting ability of any other class you have or subsequently gain. The orisons gained from the two sources are treated separately in all ways. For example, if you gain levels as a cleric after taking this feat, you still know the orisons you gained from this feat, have the same number of slots per day for them, and cast them as a caster of one-half your character level. The orisons you gain for being a cleric must be chosen daily from the list and prepared normally, and your caster level for those is equal to your cleric level plus any adjustments you would normally be entitled to because of domains or other factors.

If the check fails, you lose the spell and fail to cast it, just as if you had failed a Concentration check to cast the spell defensively.<br>You still provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells from any creatures who threaten you at any point of your movement.

        <p>You are part of an order that combines the monastic discipline of the monk class with another form of training. 
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Pick one class. Taking levels in this class does not prevent you from taking monk levels. If you take levels in any other class, you lose your ability to progress as a monk as usual. If the selected class also has restricted advancement, such as the paladin class, taking monk levels does not prevent you from advancing in that class.

        <p>You are able to use a larger weapon than other people your size.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Base attack bonus +1.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can use melee weapons one size category larger than you are with a -2 penalty on the attack roll, but the amount of effort it rakes you to use the weapon does not change. For instance, a Large longsword (a one-handed weapon for a Large creature) is considered a two-handed weapon for a Medium creature that does not have this feat. For a Medium creature that has this feat, it is still considered one-handed weapon. You can wield a larger light weapon as a light weapon, or a larger two-handed weapon in two hands. You cannot wield a larger weapon in your off-hand, and you cannot use this feat with a double weapon.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: You can use a melee weapon one size category larger than you are with a -2 penalty on the attack roll, and the amount of effort it takes to use the weapon increases. A larger light weapon is considered a one-handed weapon, a larger one-handed weapon is considered a two-handed weapon, and you cannot use a larger two-handed weapon at all.

        <p>You gain a monstrous creature as an animal companion.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to gain an animal companion, Savage Empathy.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Add celestial owl, darkmantle, fiendish raven, giant fire beetle, and stirge to the list of creatures from which you may select your animal companion. As with normal animal companions, you may gain more powerful companions as you progress in level. However, you cannot simply summon these more powerful creatures as druids and rangers normally do. Rather, to gain such a monstrous companion you must first encounter such a creature and change its attitude to friendly or helpful. Changing the creature&apos;s attitude is most likely an effect of using either the Savage Empathy feat or the spell <em>charm monster</em>. If your monstrous companion&apos;s attitude ever changes to indifferent or worse, such as when a <em>charm monster</em> spell ends, the monster ceases to be your companion and may either leave or attack, as its nature dictates. The following lists serve the same purpose as those presented in the Alternative Animal Companions section of <a href="../../charbuild/classes/animalcompanion.shtml#alternate">Alternative Animal Companions</a> list.<br><strong>4th level or Higher (level 3)</strong><br>Crick<br>Krenshar<br>Pseudodragon<br>Shocker lizard<br>Worg<br><strong>7th level or Higher (level 6)</strong><br>Displacer beast<br>Griffon<br>Owlbear<br>Pegasus<br>Sea cat<br><strong>10th level or Higher (level 9)</strong><br>Arrowhawk, juvenile<br>Hell hound<br>Manticore<br>Shadow mastiff<br>Tojanida, adult<br><strong>13th level or Higher (level 12)</strong><br>Digester<br>Dragonne<br>Girallon<br>Wyvern<br>Xorn, average<br><strong>16th level or Higher (level 15)</strong><br>Arrowhawk, elder<br>Behir<br>Gray render<br>Hydra, eight-headed<br>Roc

        <p>The creature can make a spell-like ability particularly deadly to mortals.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: A mortalbane ability is a damaging spell-like ability that deals 2d6 points of additional damage when used against living non outsiders, but only half damage (rounded down) against outsiders, undead, and constructs. For example, if a mortalbane <em>cone of cold</em> from a gelugon would normally deal 45 points of damage, it actually deals 45 + 2d6 points of damage to a humanoid, but only 22 points of damage to a night hag. Creatures immune to cold - regardless of their type - still take no damage from a mortalbane <em>cone of cold</em>. <br>Mortalbane can be applied to each of a creature&apos;s spell-like abilities five times per day, though the feat does not allow the creature to exceed its normal usage limit for any ability. Thus, if a gelugon chooses to apply Mortalbane to its cone of cold ability, it can use a mortalbane cone of cold up to five times that day Thereafter, it could use its cone of cold ability again normally (since it can use cone of cold at will).
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to each of its spell-like abilities five additional times per day.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Death attack class feature.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: All creatures within 30 feet that witness you make a successful death attack must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to death attack damage dealt) or be shaken for 2d4 rounds. Any creature you consider your ally is unaffected. In addition, creatures that fail the save are so horrified by the attack that they lose their Dexterity bonus to Armor Class for 1 round.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a full-round action, you can cast one additional spell (or use a spell-like ability in combination with a spell or another spell-like ability) each round. Each spell used in this way must have a casting time of 1 action; a spell-like ability must also take no more than a standard action to use. Using this feat provokes an attack of opportunity. If your concentration is interrupted during this simultaneous casting or spell-like ability use, whether by taking damage or by some other means, a Concentration check is required for each spell or spell-like ability. Failing either Concentration check negates both spells or spell-like abilities.<br>You can also use one head to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability while another head activates a head-based special attack, such as a breath weapon or an eye ray.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Base attack bonus +4, any evil alignment.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: After delivering the killing blow to a creature (that is, reducing it to -10 hit points) with a melee weapon, you can decapitate or otherwise hack apart the corpse as a free action. Doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity and ensures that the creature cannot be revived using a <em>raise dead</em> spell. You can mutilate only one enemy per round in this fashion.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast 5th-level spells.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As long as you have an abjuration spell of 5th level or higher available to cast, you can make another creature&apos;s spellcasting harmful to itself. Use of this feat requires a melee touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. As a standard action, with a successful touch you can infuse another creature with baneful magic for a number of rounds equal to the level of the highest-level abjuration spell you have available. A successful Will save reduces this duration to 1 round.<br>For the duration of the effect, each time the target completes the casting of a spell, it takes damage equal to the level of the abjuration spell that determined the effect&apos;s duration. Since the spell&apos;s casting has already been completed, this doesn&apos;t count as damage dealt during casting.<br>As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level when casting abjuration spells.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast 1st-level spells.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a swift action, you may sacrifice a 1st-level spell slot or prepared spell to gain a virtual power point. This virtual power point allows you to gain psionic focus as a psionic character. You gain psionic focus automatically in this way and do not need to make a Concentration check. If you expend your psionic focus gained because of this feat, you also lose the virtual power point from your sacrificed spell and must sacrifice another 1st-level spell or spell slot to regain it.<br>If you already have psionic focus from another source, sacrificing a spell slot or prepared spell to this feat grants you nothing.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you invoke a wild surge, you may immediately sacrifice a prepared spell or an available spell slot to reduce the chance of suffering psychic enervation by 5% per spell level. A cleric may not sacrifice a domain spell in this way.

If the creature who speaks your name has as many or more Hit Dice as you, he is shaken for 3 rounds (no save); if he has fewer Hit Dice than you, he is frightened for 1d4+1 rounds (no save). Creatures who hear your name must make a Will save (DC 10 + your arcane spellcasting level + your Cha bonus) or become frightened for 3 rounds. Even those who succeed on the saving throw are shaken for 1 round. Neither your presence nor knowledge of you has any effect on this ability. Your name it self has gained an inherent power all its own.<br>This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

            <br><strong>Sources:</strong>  Dragon #325<br> Dragon Compendium Vol. 1<br></p>
        <p>One of your ancestors was an undead creature or possessed an unholy link with the undead brought on by frequent contact. While undead do not reproduce by normal means, their infectious taint might affect necromancers and others who deal regularly with the dead or undead. In rare instances a vampire other undead might feed off a pregnant humanoid and in allowing her to live endow the unborn child with its foul nature.<br>Your physical characteristics might vary depending on the type of undead creature from which you are descended, but you&apos;re likely to have pale or ashen skin and dark eyes and hair. The touch of undeath in a family almost exclusively comes from intelligent, corporeal undead. It takes powerful magic or extremely bizarre situations for creatures to gain this feat from unintelligent or incorporeal undead. The descendants of ghouls tend to be feral and constantly hungry. Those with ghast ancestors generally have a strong, unpleasant stench, and they often find it difficult to satiate their hunger. Lich-blooded characters value intelligence and generally have elitist personalities, often appearing gaunt and skeletal. Characters descended from mummies tend to have dull but focused personalities, and many have gaunt, dry skin. Descendants of vampires tend to have long canine teeth and commanding, seductive personalities. Wight-blooded characters tend to have clawlike fingernails, toenails, and lean, muscular bodies; they are generally hate-filled loners who hold grudges. Characters with the Necromantic Bloodline feat often favor wearing the blacks, whites, and grays of mourning.<br>Sorcerers with a touch of the undead in their family trees tend to concentrate, appropriately enough, on spells from the school of necromancy. Spells that allow the caster to control a creature&apos;s mind are popular among those descended from vampires.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your ancestry gives you a bonus spell known at each spell level, starting at 1st, from the following list.</p><ol><li><em>Cause fear</em></li><li><em>Ghoul touch</em></li><li><em>Vampiric touch</em></li><li><em>Contagion</em></li><li><em>Dominate person</em></li><li><em>Eyebite</em></li><li><em>Control undead</em></li><li><em>Trap the soul</em></li><li><em>Wail of the banshee</em></li></ol><p>
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If a character takes this feat any time after 1st level and has already learned any of the spells on this list in the class to which she applies this feat, she gains no additional spells known at those spell levels. This restriction does not apply if she learned any of these spells as a member of another spellcasting class.<br>Characters with this feat cannot learn or cast spells of the conjuration (healing) subschool, and all such spells are removed from the spell lists of all their spellcasting classes.

On days when you have created a reserve, you are weakened but not destroyed when you are dealt enough damage to reduce your hit points to 0 or lower.<br>A weakened undead acting on the strength of its necrotic reserve may take a single move action or standard action each round (but not both, nor can it take full-round actions). It moves at half speed. Taking move actions doesn&apos;t risk further injury, but performing any standard action or any other action the DM deems strenuous, including some free actions such as casting a quickened spell) immediately expends the necrotic reserve. Unless the action increased the weakened undead&apos;s hit points, it is destroyed. A weakened undead acting on the strength of its necrotic reserve is also destroyed if it is dealt additional damage after the attack that first weakened it.<br>An undead may only rely on a necrotic reserve up to once per day, even if it engages in additional feeding following its successful return to positive hit points.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Undead reduced to 0 hit points or lower are immediately destroyed.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Caster level 1st.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You are attuned to one type of node and the magical power it provides. When you choose this feat, choose a type of node (earth, evil, or Shadow Weave).

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Node Spellcasting, caster level 1st.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Each time you take this feat, choose two spells of any level that you know and can cast. If you are a spellcaster who prepares spells, you can now prepare those two spells in addition to your normal spell complement as long as you are in a node to which you are attuned, just as if you had two extra spell slots per day. These extra prepared spells are stored in the node instead of in your mind. You can cast them normally while you are within that node, even if you have left the node and returned since storing them there.<br>If you are a spellcaster who does not prepare spells, choose two spells that you know. You can now cast those two spells while in a node to which you are attuned as if you had two extra spell slots per day available. Each such slot can be used only to cast its designated spell; it cannot be used for any other spell (including the other spell designated with this feat). If you leave the node, these extra spell slots become unavailable to you, but you can use them again if you return, provided that you haven&apos;t already used them since the last time you rested.<br>You do not need to designate a specific node in which to store your spells when you choose this feat, but you can have spells stored in only one node at a time. You can change the node in which your spells are stored by meditating for 1 hour inside the new node you have selected.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). You can then modify any spell with the chosen descriptor to deal nonlethal damage instead of normal energy damage. The nonlethal spell works normally in all respects except the type of damage dealt-for example, a nonlethal fireball has the same range and area, but since it deals nonlethal damage instead of energy damage, it will not damage objects or set fire to combustibles in the area.<br>A nonlethal spell uses a spell slot one level higher than the spell&apos;s normal level.

        <p>You can cast spells that have verbal components without actually verbalizing the words.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can cast spells with verbal components without needing to utter the actual verbal components. You still make noise when casting such a spell (which may be anything from recognizable speech to elaborate song to simple growls), but the noise is unrecognizable as a verbal spell component. (A <em>silence</em> spell still would prevent you from completing the spell, for example.) Spells without verbal components are not affected.<br>This feat is most beneficial to races incapable of speech in the traditional sense, but still capable of communication. However, it also can prove helpful to characters wishing to disguise the verbal components of their spells.

If you hit, you deal normal unarmed damage. You can use one of the following feats in conjunction with this attack, exactly as if you were making a normal unarmed strike: Stunning Fist, Falling Star Strike, Freezing the Lifeblood, Unbalancing Strike, or Pain Touch. If you choose not to apply one of these feats to your attack, you deal double normal damage instead. Use of this ability is a supernatural effect.

Your normal truename - the one a truenamer would use if he didn&apos;t know your personal truename - is unaffected by this feat.

        <p>Your knowledge of the supernatural allows you to exploit most attempts to manipulate magical energies.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks, Spellcraft 5 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You may make an attack of opportunity against an opponent you threaten who dismisses a spell, directs or redirects an active spell, casts a quickened or swift spell, or attempts to turn or rebuke undead. If your attack is successful, your opponent must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + damage dealt) or lose the action that provoked the attack of opportunity.

        <p>Your study of the terrible powers of the beholder has given you insight into new ways to prepare and cast spells.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Knowledge (dungeoneering) 4 ranks, two or more eyes.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can cast a spell with a casting time of 1 full round or less as an ocular spell. An ocular spell does not take effect immediately, but is instead held in one of your eyes for up to 8 hours. You can store only two ocular spells in this fashion, even if you have more than two eyes. Only ray spells and spells with a target other than personal can be cast as ocular spells.<br>When you choose, you can then cast both of the ocular spells as a full-round action; the spells become brilliant blasts that shoot out from your eyes. You can choose different targets for the two ocular spells.<br>When you release an ocular spell, its effect changes to a ray with a range of up to 60 feet. If the spell previously would have affected multiple creatures, it now affects only the creature struck by the ray. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike your target with an ocular spell, and the target is still permitted any saving throw allowed by the spell.<br>Example: Ferno, an 11th-level wizard with the Ocular Spell feat, could prepare two <em>scorching ray</em> spells as ocular spells, casting them at the beginning of the day. In combat, he can take a full-round action to fire off both scorching ray spells. He can fire each spell at a different target, and he gets all three rays from each spell.<br>An ocular spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

        <p>You gain a number of abilities and advantages related to dreams and magic.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Dreamtelling, ability to cast spells of any sort.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Oneiromancy grants you a number of interrelated bonuses. First, when casting spells in a nightmare realm, your spells always work as normal; you do not risk the same mishaps that other casters experience.<br>Second, while in the dreamscape, you are considered to have Spell Focus (enchantment) and Spell Focus (illusion), due to your ability to manipulate the thoughts of dreamers and the stuff of dreams. If you already have Spell Focus in one or both of these schools, the DC bonus to saves stacks so long as you remain within the dreamscape.<br>Third, you can target your offensive spells at a target&apos;s dream self, rather than his physical form. Because this deals mental damage only, it transforms all damage dealt by that spell into nonlethal damage. This effect functions only on creatures that both sleep and dream: Constructs, plants, undead, and elves are immune to this effect. Only spells that target a single creature or specific number of creatures benefit from this effect; you cannot apply it to spells that target an area.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Because you are more tightly connected to the world of dreams, you are more susceptible to certain types of mental manipulation. You take a -1 penalty on saves against enchantment and illusion spells and effects when in the physical realm. If you are slain while mentally traveling the dreamscape, your physical body dies, whether or not this is the case for most travelers.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Casters in nightmare realms have a chance of mishap when casting spells. In some instances, those who die in the dreamscape experience effects other than death in the real world. See Adventuring in Nightmare Realms in Chapter 3 <strong>Heroes of Horror</strong>.

        <p>You are an unusually lawful Abyssal heritor.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Non-chaotic alignment, base Will save +4.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your alignment is not affected by the Abyssal heritor feats you possess. Spells and effects that are keyed to alignment affect you as if you were chaotic, as well as your actual alignment. For example, you become immune to spells such as <em>chaos hammer</em> and <em>word of chaos</em>, you could wield an anarchic weapon without fear of gaining a negative level, and you could take the Primordial Scion feat despite its chaotic alignment prerequisite.

        <p>You are either stunningly beautiful or wretchedly hideous. Either way, your appearance can be terribly unsettling to others upon whom you focus your attentions.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Cha 15.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you take this feat, you must decide whether you are unusually beautiful or unusually hideous. Once you make this choice, you cannot change it. You gain a bonus on Perform checks (if you chose beauty) or Intimidate checks (if you chose ugliness) equal to the number of Abyssal heritor feats you possess.<br>As a full-round action, you can attempt to distract a target within 30 feet by focusing your attention upon it. The target must be able to see you and can resist your distracting appearance by making a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier). Failure indicates that the target is fascinated (if you are beautiful) or sickened (if you are ugly) for as long as you remain in its line of sight. You can affect a specific creature in this manner only once per day. This ability is usable a number of times per day equal to the number of Abyssal heritor feats you possess.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Your appearance is so striking that it&apos;s difficult to hide. You take a -2 penalty on Disguise checks.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Aasimar or tiefling, base Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saves +2, Celestial Bloodline or Fiendish Bloodline
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain wings (feathered if an aasimar, batlike if a tiefling), allowing you to fly at your land speed (average maneuverability). A medium or heavy load that would reduce your land speed reduces your fly speed a proportionate amount.

        <p>You burn your life force to strengthen your powers.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: While manifesting a power, you can increase your effective manifester level by one, but in so doing you take 1d8 points of damage. At 8th level, you can choose to increase your effective manifester level by two, but you take 3d8 points of damage. At 15th level, you can increase your effective manifester level by three, but you take 5d8 points of damage.<br>The effective increase in manifester level increases the number of power points you can expend on a single power manifestation, as well as increasing all manifester level-dependent effects, such as range, duration, and overcoming power resistance.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Your manifester level is equal to your total levels in classes that manifest powers.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Vulnerability to energy, Iron Will, Suppress Weakness.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can completely suppress your vulnerability to a type of energy. When subjected to an attack based on that type of energy, you take no extra damage.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: A creature vulnerable to a type of energy takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from that energy type, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed or if the save is a success or failure.

        <p>You can deal a nasty attack to anything that tries to crush or run over you.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Close-Quarters Fighting, Power Attack, base attack bonus +6.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can use a slashing or piercing weapon to make an attack of opportunity against a foe using an attack designed to batter you from above, such as an overrun, trample, power dive, or dragon crush attack. You cannot use this feat if you are flat-footed or already grappled. This feat does not grant you an additional attack of opportunity in a round, so the feat does not help you if you have no attacks of opportunity available.<br>You gain a special attack modifier based on your opponent&apos;s size, as shown below. If your attack hits, you deal triple damage.</p><table class="table" style="width:30em"><tr><td>Opponent Size</td><td>Bonus</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>+16</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>+12</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>+8</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>Medium or smaller</td><td>+0</td></tr></table><p>
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Any extra damage dice your attack deals (such as from a sneak attack ability or a weapon special ability) are not multiplied by this feat.<br>If you score a critical hit with your attack, the extra damage you deal stacks with the extra damage from this feat. Add the damage multipliers together according to the standard rule (see Multiplying, page 304 of the Player&apos;s Handbook). For example, if your weapon deals double damage on a critical hit, any critical hit you score while also using this feat deals quadruple damage.

        <h1>Overpower</h1>
        <p><strong>Type</strong>: Metapsionic
            <br><strong>Source:</strong>  Web<br></p>
        <p>You can manifest a power at twice its normal effect.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Fortify Power.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: All variable, numeric effects of an overpowered power are doubled. An overpowered power deals twice as much damage, cures twice as many hit points, affects twice as many targets, and so on, as appropriate. For example an overpowered lesser concussion deals twice the amount of damage (roll 1d6 and multiply the result by 2). Saving throws and opposed rolls (such as the one you make when you manifest negate psionics) are not affected. Powers without random variables are not affected. An overpowered power costs a number of power points equal to its standard cost + 6.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can apply overpower to the same power multiple times. You can&apos;t break the power point limit of the manifester level minus one when using overpower. For instance, a lesser concussion overpowered twice deals 1d6 times 3 damage for a cost of 13 power points. Thus, a 14th-level manifester could have used the power as described in the example above, but a 13th-level manifester could not.<br>You can simultaneously apply overpower in conjunction with fortify power. You can&apos;t break the power point limit of the manifester level minus one when using these feats in conjunction with each other. For instance, a lesser concussion overpowered once and fortified twice deals 1d6 times 2.5 damage for a cost of 10 power points. Thus an 11th-level manifester could have used the power as described in the example above, but a 10th-level manifester could not. See Tables 1-1, 1-2 and 1-3 for available combinations, optimal combinations, and maximum effect.

        <p>When using a power that allows you to choose a type of energy, you have a wider range of possible choices owing to your ability to mix energy with matter.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Privileged Energy
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you take this feat, you must choose the energy type you selected with your Privileged Energy feat. To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. Upon manifesting a damaging energy power that matches your choice of energy, you can access paraelemental energy to further enhance your energy power with ice (cold), magma (fire), ooze (electricity), or smoke (sonic). The paraelemenral power still possesses its underlying energy descriptor.<br>Targets damaged by paraelemental powers might be affected by the additional effects noted below. In the case of an energy power that requires a saving throw, targets are only subject to these additional effects on a failed save. A successful save against the energy power negates the paraelemental effect. In the case of an energy power that normally does not allow a saving throw (such as energy ray), a target of a paraelemenral power can attempt a Fortitude save at the power&apos;s DC to negate only the extra effect.<br><em>Ice</em>: As cold energy, but also limits affected foes to a single move action or standard action (not both) for 1 round as they attempt to free themselves from ice. The power is considered to be in effect during this rime and can be dispelled normally.<br><em>Magma</em>: As fire energy, but also deals an additional 2d6 points of fire damage on the round following the attack from lingering magma. The power is considered to be in effect during this time and can be dispelled normally.<br><em>Ooze</em>: As electricity energy, but the target is also covered in goo and becomes entangled for 1 round, after which the goo evaporates. The power is considered to be in effect during this time and can be dispelled normally.<br><em>Smoke</em>: As sonic, but targets that breathe spend the following round coughing, and so are limited to a single move action or standard action (nor both) for 1 round. The power is considered to be in effect during this time and can be dispelled normally.<br>Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power&apos;s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take this feat, choose another energy type (cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) that you have also selected with the Privileged Energy feat. You can now manifest that power with the matching paraelemental effect described above.

Most are very thin, but not to the point of unhealthiness. They generally wear plain clothing in subdued hues of gray or white. Creatures with shadowy or ethereal ancestry tend toward neutrality and often have quiet, secretive personalities. Many penumbra-blooded creatures prefer dark places and void direct sunlight as much as possible.<br>Sorcerers who possess a penumbral ancestor favor spells that conceal places and people as well as spells that access the Plane of Shadow or Ethereal Plane.

        <p>You ignore the miss chance provided by certain magical effects.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Con 13, Blind-Fight, Mage Slayer.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your fierce contempt for magic allows you to disregard the miss chance granted by spells or spell-like abilities such as <em>darkness, blur, invisibility, obscuring mist, ghostform</em>, and spells when used to create concealment effects (such as a wizard using <em>permanent image</em> to fill a corridor with illusory fire and smoke). In addition, when facing a creature protected by <em>mirror image</em>, you can immediately pick out the real creature from its figments. Your ability to ignore the miss chance granted by magical concealment doesn&apos;t grant you any ability to ignore nonmagical concealment (so you would still have a 20% miss chance against an invisible creature hiding in fog, for example).
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Taking this feat reduces your caster level for all your spells and spell-like abilities by 4.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Con 13, Mage Slayer.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your contempt for magic is so fierce that as a standard action you can make a melee attack that ignores any bonuses to Armor Class granted by spells (including spell trigger or spell completion effects created by magic items such as wands or potions). If you deal damage to your opponent, you also instantly and automatically dispel all that opponent&apos;s spells and spell effects that grant a bonus to Armor Class.

        <p>Your evocation spells ignore an amount of energy resistance.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spell Focus (evocation) or evoker level 1st.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you cast an evocation spell that deals energy damage (acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic), you can choose for 10 points of energy damage dealt by the spell to become untyped damage to which energy resistance and immunity do not apply. If the spell deals multiple types of energy damage, you choose how much of each type is converted by this feat after rolling damage.

        <p>Your cold spells are so cold that they can damage creatures normally resistant or immune to cold.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can only apply this metamagic feat to spells with the cold descriptor. Piercing cold spells are so horribly cold that they are capable of damaging creatures normally unharmed by or resistant to cold. Piercing cold spells completely ignore any resistance to cold a creature possesses, bypassing this resistance and dealing damage to the target as if it did not possess any resistance to cold at all. They are still entitled to whatever other defenses the attack allows (such as saving throws and spell resistance).<br>Creatures normally immune to cold can be damaged by piercing cold spells as well. Piercing cold spells deal half damage to these creatures (or one-quarter on a successful saving throw).<br>For example, Mialee casts a <em>piercing cold cone of cold</em> at a night hag, a creature normally immune to cold. She makes her level check to penetrate the night hag&apos;s spell resistance, but the night hag makes her Reflex save against the spell. Mialee rolls the dice, and her cone of cold deals 42 points of cold damage; since the night hag made her save, the damage is halved to 21 points. This damage is then halved again (since the night hag is normally immune to cold), and 10 points of cold damage are actually dealt to the night hag, who is both shocked and enraged at this unexpected turn of events.<br>Creatures with the cold subtype can tell that a piercing cold spell is colder than normal, but they remain undamaged by the attack.<br>Creatures with the fire subtype who are damaged by a piercing cold spell take double normal damage instead of the usual +50%.<br>A piercing cold spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This feat can only be applied to spells that require a touch attack (either melee or ranged).

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Two-Weapon Fighting, base attack bonus +4.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This feat can be used only when fighting against an opponent who is using a shield and who is your size or one size category bigger or smaller than you. When making a full attack action, you may give up all your off-hand attacks. If you do, you momentarily pin your opponent&apos;s shield with your off-hand weapon, and all your remaining attacks during the round are made with your primary weapon (with the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons), and your foe gains no Armor Class benefit from her shield until the end of your action.

        <p>Forge a link between you and power-rich planar locations, referred to as planar touchstones (see Planar Touchstones, page 153, Planar Handbook).
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Portable object of at least 250 gp value native to any designated planar touchstone site, Knowledge (the planes) 8 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose any site designated as a planar touchstone for which you also possess an object native to that location, as noted in this feat&apos;s prerequisite. When this feat is first taken, forging a link between yourself and a chosen planar touchstone takes 24 hours of uninterrupted concentration. To forge a link, you must spend 10 experience points and expend the object described in this feat&apos;s prerequisite.<br>Once the link is forged, you gain the base ability described for that touchstone. If you physically visit the planar location once you&apos;ve forged a link, you also gain a higher-order ability with a limited number of uses, as described for that planar touchstone. You may repeatedly visit the planar touchstone, each time recharging your usages of the higher-order ability. Usages of a higher-order ability do not stack, so visiting your planar touchstone prior to using up any of your higher-order usages confers no additional benefit.<br>Once you&apos;ve established a link with one planar touchstone site by taking this feat, you may also freely visit other planar touchstones. When you do so and fulfill the higher-order ability&apos;s recharge condition for the alternate site, you immediately gain the base ability of the new planar touchstone site and lose the base ability of the previous site. You also lose any remaining uses of the higher-order ability of your previously selected site (if any), and instead gain the specified number of higher-order ability uses appropriate to the new site.<br>In this way, you can &apos;unplug&apos; from one site and &apos;plug in&apos; to a new planar touchstone site as often as you desire. Thus, after expending the raw materials and experience points for making your first connection, making subsequent connections with different sites is as easy as fulfilling the higher-order recharge condition.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Alertness, Track, Survival 15 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Using the Track feat, you can follow tracks even if your quarry has used a teleport or plane shift effect to escape. When the you reach the location at which the magical method of escape was employed, you can attempt a Survival check (DC 30). Success means you are aware that a teleport or plane shift effect has been used. If your check result beats the DC by 10 or more, you know which effect was used. If your check result beats the DC by 15 or more, you know the direction in which your quarry has moved (in the case of teleportation) or the destination plane (in the case of plane shift). In any case, if you locate the creature&apos;s tracks within hour per character level, you can instantly identify them as your quarry&apos;s and attempt another Survival check (DCs as given in the Survival skill description in the Player&apos;s Handbook) to determine how fresh they are.

        <p>One of your ancestors had an unusually close tie to the natural world. Possibly the rarest of ancestries, only the most powerful spellcasters or deities can cause the melding of plants and animals.<br>Plant-blooded creatures tend to have brown skin and green eyes, and they generally act more patiently and quietly than their peers. Scions of flowering plants are often beautiful and vain, in love with bright colors and prone to extravagance. Those who descend from vines have long thin bodies with tangled masses of hair and combative dispositions. Fungal descendants tend toward pale skin and hair tones, preferring sedentary lives and dark, cool places. Tree-blood creatures stand taller than their peers and have quiet but friendly personalities, content with deep thoughts and slow actions.<br>Sorcerers with plants in their ancestry prefer spells that manipulate themselves or the environment around them to protect or grow life.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your ancestry gives you a bonus spell known at each spell level, starting at 1st, from the following list.</p><ol><li><em>Endure elements</em></li><li><em>False Life</em></li><li><em>Water breathing</em></li><li><em>Minor creation</em></li><li><em>Transmute rock to mud</em></li><li><em>Control water</em></li><li><em>Control weather</em></li><li><em>Control plants</em></li><li><em>Imprisonment</em></li></ol><p>
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If a character takes this feat any time after 1st level and has already learned any of the spells on this list in the class to which she applies this feat, she gains no additional spells known at those spell levels. This restriction does not apply if she learned any of these spells as a member of another spellcasting class.<br>In almost every culture, plants and growing things represent life and growth. Thus, characters who possess this life-centered bloodline cannot learn or cast spells with the death descriptor, and all such spells are removed from the spell lists of all their spellcasting classes.

(A melee touch spell must deal damage to deliver the effect of an injury poison.)<br>The dose of poison used as the component is expended when you cast the spell, whether or not the spell or poison successfully affects the target.

        <p>Your claws drip with poison.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Claws of the Beast, any two other Abyssal heritor feats.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per hour, you can secrete poison onto your claws as a swift action. This poison remains in place until you damage a target with your claws. At that point, the creature struck must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Con modifier) or take 1d4 points of Strength damage. One minute later, the victim must save again or take an additional 1d4 points of Strength damage. You are immune to your own poison.<br>The poison you secrete from your talons cannot be collected or preserved.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>:  Although you are immune to your own toxin, its presence tends to complicate the process of providing medical aid to others. Therefore, you take a -2 penalty on Heal checks.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Exposure to cone of cold or ice storm spell.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per day, you can make the ground icy in a 20-foot-radius spread around you. Each square in that area becomes covered with ice, so it takes two squares of movement to enter each square, and the DC of Balance and Tumble checks there increases by 5. A DC 10 Balance check is required to run or charge across the ice. The ice remains for t minute or until exposed to fire.<br>You can&apos;t use this feat if you aren&apos;t touching the ground, and it doesn&apos;t work if the air temperature is above 100 degrees.

If he later gained a fighter level, he would gain the remainder of the bonus, and his psion manifester level would become 9th (since he now has 9 Hit Dice).<br>A character with two or more manifesting classes (such as a psychic warrior/psion) must choose which class gains the feat&apos;s effect.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You are treated as having 4 more levels of soulknife for the purpose of manifesting your mind blade (increasing its enhancement bonus and its special abilities). This benefit cannot grant you an effective soulknife level greater than your Hit Dice. However, even if you can&apos;t benefit from the full bonus immediately, if you later gain Hit Dice from levels that do not improve your mind blade, you might be able to apply the rest of the bonus.<br>For example, a human 6th-level soulknife/3rd-level ranger would have an effective soulknife level of 9th (because he has 9 Hit Dice), thus allowing him to manifest a +2 mind blade with a +1 special ability equivalent. If he later increased his ranger level to 4th (increasing his total Hit Dice to 10) he could take frill advantage of this feat, manifesting his mind blade as a 10th-level soulknife and increasing his mind blade&apos;s special abilities to a +2 special ability equivalent.<br>This feat affects only the mind blade&apos;s enhancement bonus and special abilities.

However, even if you can&apos;t benefit from the full bonus immediately, if you later gain non-caster-level HD you maybe able to apply the rest of the bonus.<br>For example, a human 5th-level cleric/3rd-level fighter who selects this feat would increase his cleric caster level from 5th to 8th (since he has 8 HD). If he later gained a fighter level, he would gain the remainder of the bonus and his cleric caster level would become 9th (since he now has 9 HD).<br>A character with two or more spellcasting classes (such as a bard/sorcerer or a ranger/druid) must choose which class gains the feat&apos;s effect.<br>This does not affect your spells per day or spells known, it only increases your caster level, which would help you penetrate SR and increase the duration and other effects of your spells.

        <h1>Pressure Point Strike</h1>
        <p><strong>Type</strong>: General
            <br><strong>Source:</strong>  Dragon #336<br></p>
        <p>You know how to strike opponents in supernaturally vulnerable locations.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Dex 13, Wis 13, Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist, base attack bonus +8, <em>ki</em> strike (magic).
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You must declare that you are using this feat, as well as which pressure point you wish to strike, before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). You can use Pressure Point Strike as an attack against an enemy or to remove a detrimental condition from an ally. As an attack, Pressure Point Strike forces a foe damaged by your unarmed strike to make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A defender who fails this saving throw suffers the effect of the targeted pressure point. This ability only works on giants, humanoids, and monstrous humanoids. Other creature types either lack pressure points or have very different ones.<br>You can aid an ally by bolstering him in some way or by attempting to remove a detrimental condition. Make a level check against the DC of the effect that caused your ally&apos;s condition to remove the condition.<br>The different uses of this feat count against the number of times per day you can use the Stunning Fist feat in specific amounts. See Dragon #336, page 103.

        <p>Your body adjusts quickly to changes in water pressure.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Deep Diver, Endurance, Skill Focus (Swim), Swim 4 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once you successfully make Fortitude saving throw to resist damage caused by water pressure, you no longer need to make Fortitude saving throws to avoid damage caused by pressure at that depth. If your depth changes by 100 feet, you must begin making new Fortitude saving throws as normal until you succeed again.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: You must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 15 + 1 for each additional saving throw) once every minute to avoid suffering damage from water pressure.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Proficiency in all martial weapons.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You suffer a -4 penalty on all attack rolls made with exotic weapons, simple weapons, unarmed attacks, and touch attacks.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Access to the Fire, Summer, Sun, Travel, or Water domain.
            <br><strong>Region</strong>: Wastes
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can use a spell slot currently occupied by a prepared spell that is not a domain spell to cast a spell of equal or lower level that appears on the following list: <em>cloak of shade, control weather, create food and water, create water, endure elements, heroes&apos; feast, hydrate, protection from dessication, protection from energy</em>, and <em>resist energy</em>.

        <p>Your rapport with one of your contacts is stronger than your relationship with the rest.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Favored.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you gain this feat, select one of your existing contacts to be named your primary contact. Choose one skill associated with the organization to which your contact belongs. You gain 1 bonus rank in that skill (even if doing so would put you above your normal maximum ranks for that skill). In addition, you can double the frequency with which you can call upon your primary contact for no-charge favors. For example, if your primary contact normally provides its no-charge favor once per month, you can now call upon that favor twice per month.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: This feat cannot be taken more than once. If the primary contact associated with this feat dies or is otherwise removed from the campaign, the DM can, at his discretion, either replace that contact with a new contact from the same organization or allow you to name one of your other contacts as your primary contact. In either event, you do not gain the bonus skill rank a second time, but neither do you lose it just because your contact has left the campaign.

        <p>Your wild shape forms are stronger than normal.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Wild shape ability.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you assume a wild shape form, you can opt to cause the shape assumed to be a primeval form of the creature that existed in the ancient past during a vast ice age. Doing so grants the new form a +2 racial bonus to Strength, a +2 bonus to its natural armor, and resistance to cold 10. A primeval wild shape has a much shorter duration than normal, since the enhanced qualities of the new shape drain your supernatural energies much more quickly. A primeval wild shape has a duration of 1 round per druid level (or per level of the class that granted you the wild shape ability) instead of the normal 1 hour per druid level.

        <p>You use screeches, wild gesticulations, and extra material components to give your spells additional power.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This feat only functions when you cast a spell that does not already have a verbal, somatic, or material component. For each component you voluntarily add, you increase the effective caster level of the spell by +1. You can only add a component that&apos;s not already present in the spell. For example, you can&apos;t add a somatic component to a <em>gaseous form</em> spell, because it already has one. You could add a verbal component, however.<br>The verbal component you add consists of animalistic shouts, screams, and growls. The DC of Listen checks to hear you cast a spell is -5 (before modifying for distance). The somatic component is also more complex, so you must have two hands free to add a somatic component with this feat. The extra material component you add with this feat must be a rare plant found in the frostfell, which requires a successful DC 15 Profession (herbalist) check to locate.<br>This feat originally appeared in Races of Faer&#xFB;n.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your natural weapons, as well as any weapons you wield, are treated as chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. In addition, attacks you make with such weapons deal an extra 1d6 points of damage to lawful creatures. This bonus increases by an additional 1d6 for every four Abyssal heritor feats you possess.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Because of the chaotic whispers in your head, you take a -2 penalty on Listen checks.

Any attempt by you or your allies to influence an animal using a Charisma-based skill or ability (such as Handle Animal or wild empathy) within this area suffers a -1 penalty.

The mist extends out in a 60-foot-radius emanation centered on you and flows through the air as you move, keeping you at the center of its area. The mist provides concealment to creatures within the cloud. While in the mist, creatures (including you) 5 feet away from each other have concealment, and creatures separated by more than 5 feet have total concealment from each other.<br>In addition, mindless undead creatures within the cloud gain a +2 deflection bonus to AC.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can spend a full-round action attempting to psionically focus your psicrystal (see <a href="../../charbuild/skills/concentration.shtml#psionics">Concentration skill</a> description). At any time when you need to expend your psionic focus, you can expend your psicrystal&apos;s psionic focus instead, as long as the crystal is within 5 feet of you. Psionically focusing your psicrystal works just like focusing yourself. The psicrystal cannot focus itself-only the owner can spend the time to focus the crystal.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one power you know of 8th level or lower. Your psicrystal can now manifest this power once per day as your manifester level (the psicrystal gains sufficient power points to manifest the power once). You cannot bestow a power upon your psicrystal if the power normally has an experience point cost.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, you can give your psicrystal knowledge of new power (and it gains sufficient power points to manifest that power once).<br>All power points gained by a psicrystal from multiple applications of this feat go into its reserve and can be used manifest the powers it knows as you desire. For instance, you can give your psicrystal an 8th-level power (cost 15 power points) and a 4th-level power (cost 7 power points). It gains a reserve of 22 power points, which it could use to manifest each power once, or it could manifest the 4th-level power three times.

        <p>You become more efficient at psionic combat.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Minimum level 6th+, any other psionic combat feat*
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You have developed a psionic combat power point buffer that allows you to activate psionic attack and defense modes at 1/2 the normal cost (minimum 1 power point). You may choose to designate a maximum of half of your total power points per day as buffer points for use in psionic combat only (subject to available power points -- you cannot spend what you do not have). You can do this at any time, but charging the buffer is a full-round action. If in combat while charging the buffer, you are considered flat-footed for that round of psionic combat. You can use power points stored in the buffer only for psionic defense and attack modes, and they have a duration of 1 hour per manifester level. Once the duration has been reached, no additional power points can be placed in the buffer that day. Half of any unused points are returned to the character at the end of the duration; the remaining half dissipates harmlessly. The buffer may be dismissed at any time and is treated as though it had reached its duration.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: *Psionic combat feats that can be used as a prerequisite include Psychic Assault, Mental Adversary, Mind Trap, Psychic Bastion, Disarm Mind, and Mind Blind.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one type of energy: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic for which you already have selected for the Psionic Energy Substitution feat. You can modify a power with an energy designator to add an equal amount of the chosen type of energy. The altered power works normally in all respects except for the type of damage dealt. For instance, a sonic admixtured fireball would deal 5d4 points of sonic damage and 5d4 points of fire damage.<br>Even opposed types of energy, such as fire and cold, can be combined using this feat. An admixed power costs a number of power points equal to its standard cost +8.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can gain this feat multiple times, choosing a different type of energy each time. You can use Psionic Energy Admixture to further alter a power that has already been modified with Psionic Energy Substitution. You can also use Psionic Energy Admixture to include your chosen energy type with a power that already uses the same type, in effect doubling the damage dice.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Con 15.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When a foe strikes you in melee combat, the foe immediately loses its psionic focus, if any.<br>Also, if you are the target of a power, the manifester of the power must spend an additional number of power points equal to your Wisdom bonus, or the power fails (all the power points spent on the power are still lost).

For example, a 4th-level spellthief/1st-level psychic warrior could steal tip to 3 power points; if he used this ability against a 2nd-level psion he could steal only 2 power points, since that is the target&apos;s manifester level.<br>You can use the stolen power points only to manifest a psionic power you already know.

        <p>You can charge your damaging spell-like abilities with celestial energy that leaves good creatures unharmed.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any good alignment.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This feat adds the good descriptor to a spell-like ability. Furthermore, if the ability deals damage, neutral creatures take half damage, or one-quarter with a successful saving throw (if allowed), while good creatures take no damage at all. Evil outsiders affected by the ability take extra damage: The ability&apos;s damage is increased by one die type (each 1d6 becomes 1d8, each 1d8 becomes 2d6, and so on, using the same progression as weapons increasing in size~. For example <em>purified lightning bolt</em> cast by an avoral deals 8d6 points of electricity damage to evil creatures, half damage to neutral creatures, and no damage at all to good creatures caught in its path. Evil outsiders (except ones immune to electricity) take 8d8 points of damage. Each of your spell-like abilities can be purified three times per day, though this feat does not allow you to exceed your normal usage limit for any ability. Thus, if a tulani eladrin chooses to purify its chain lightning ability, it can use a purified chain lightning up to three times that day. Thereafter, it could use its chain lightning ability again normally (since it can use chain lightning at will), or it could purify another of its spell-like abilities, such as <em>meteor swarm</em>.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any good alignment.

Furthermore, if the spell deals damage, neutral creatures take half damage, or one-quarter with a successful saving throw (if allowed), while good creatures take no damage at all. Evil outsiders affected by the spell take extra damage: The spell&apos;s damage is increased by one die type (each 1d6 becomes 1d8, each 1d8 becomes 2d6, and so on, using the same progression as weapons increasing in size). For example, a <em>purified lightning bolt</em> cast by a 7th-level wizard deals 7d6 points of electricity damage to evil creatures, half damage to neutral creatures, and no damage at all to good creatures caught in its path. Evil outsiders (except ones immune to electricity) take 7d8 points of damage.<br>A purified spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you begin your turn stunned or dazed, you can make a new saving throw at the original DC of the effect that stunned or dazed you in an attempt to recover. Recovering from being stunned or dazed in this way is a move action, if the effect that caused you to become stunned or dazed did not allow a saving throw, you can recover by succeeding on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 HD or caster level of originator of effect + relevant ability modifier, or Cha modifier if there is not an obvious ability linked to the effect).
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: You are stunned or dazed as long as the effect calls for, and do not have an opportunity to recover early.

A rapid spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A spell can be made rapid and quickened only if its original casting time was 1 full round. This feat can be applied to a spell cast spontaneously as long as its original casting time was longer than 1 full round.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Wis 13, Jump 5 ranks, base attack bonus +6.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The Raptor School feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers.<br><strong>Eagle&apos;s Swoop</strong>: To use this maneuver, you must charge a foe or jump down on your enemy from at least 10 feet up (see page 77 of the Player&apos;s Handbook). Make a Jump check as a free action immediately before your next attack. Prior to making the roll, determine the DC of the check: either DC 15 for a chance to deal 2 extra points of damage or DC 25 for a chance to deal 4 extra points of damage. If you fail this Jump check, you miss your target, and if you fail this Jump check by 5 or more, you fall prone in an adjacent square.<br><strong>Falcon&apos;s Feathers</strong>: To use this maneuver, you must be wearing a cloak. As a standard action, you can whip the cloak around you in a distracting fashion. Make an attempt to feint in combat (see page 68 of the Player&apos;s Handbook), using your base attack bonus instead of your Bluff modifier. If you succeed, your target is treated as flat-footed for the next melee attack you make against it.<br><strong>Hawk&apos;s Eye</strong>: To use this maneuver, you must spend at least 1 full round observing your foe. While doing so, you can take no other actions. The next melee attack you make against your foe gains a +2 bonus on the attack and damage rolls for every round you have just spent observing the foe, to a maximum bonus of +6 (for 3 consecutive full rounds of observation). If the target of your observation attacks you while you&apos;re observing, or if you don&apos;t make the melee attack within 3 rounds of the end of your observation, you don&apos;t get the benefit of the feat.

            <br><strong>Region</strong>: Rashemen
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When casting a spell that summons air or earth elementals, you may choose to summon an orglash or thomil instead. (see the Orglash and Thomil entries in Chapter 6: Monsters of the East, <em>Unapproachable East</em>.) For example, if you cast <em>summon monster V</em>, which can summon a medium elemental, you may summon an orglash or thomil using a medium elemental as the base creature. If you cast elemental swarm, you could opt to summon orglashes or thomils based on large, huge, and greater air or earth elementals. Altering the spell in this manner does not change any other aspects of the spell. You may use this ability outside of Rashemen.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). By expending one of your Stunning Fist uses for the day, you imbue your next unarmed attack with disruptive ki that mimics the effects of mild viper venom. If that attack hits, it deals normal damage and forces the target to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10+ 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier). A creature that fails the saving throw takes 1d3 points of Constitution damage and must make a similar saving throw 1 minute later or take another 1d3 points of Constitution damage. This feat can be used only once per round.

        <p>You change the effect of a ray spell to a 30-foot radius burst centered on yourself.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: A ray burst hits all targets (friend or foe) within 30 feet. Targets within 30 feet are allowed a Reflex save to avoid the burst. Any targets that do not avoid the effect are treated as if they were hit by the ray spell. Any target with 100% cover with respect to the caster is not affected. A ray burst spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: All targets in the area of effect receive Reflex saves to avoid the effect, but are otherwise affected as if they were hit by the ray spell. A coned ray uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

        <p>You maintain a ray spell for an additional round.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When the extended ray spell is cast, you can use your next action to attack with the same ray. You can designate either a different target or the same target. A successful ranged touch attack is required for the second target. If any other actions are taken, or the spell is disrupted before your next action, then you lose the extended spell (though any previous effects remain). An extended ray uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: A split ray can hit three targets. A successful ranged touch attack is needed for each target, and each roll incurs 5-4 penalty to hit. A target cannot be attacked more than once with a given spell. A split ray uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

        <p>You have mastered the art of delivering precise strikes against nonliving creatures while channeling spell energy through your melee attacks.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Sneak attack, caster level 5th.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: To activate this feat, you must sacrifice one of your daily allotment of spells (minimum spell level 1st). Doing this is a swift action that doesn&apos;t provoke attacks of opportunity.<br>In exchange, you gain an insight bonus on your melee attack rolls and damage rolls for 1 round. The bonus on attack rolls equals the level of the spell sacrificed. The bonus on damage rolls is 1d6 points per level of the spell sacrificed, plus any extra damage based on your sneak attack ability.<br>These bonuses apply against only one type of creature, depending on the type of spell sacrificed. If you sacrifice an arcane spell, they apply against constructs; if the sacrificed spell is divine, the bonuses apply against undead.<br>Example: A 5th-level wizard/1st-level rogue activates this feat, sacrificing a prepared <em>web</em> spell. She gains a +2 insight bonus on her melee attack rolls against constructs for 1 round, and also adds 3d6 points of damage to successful attacks against constructs during that round (2d6 for the 2nd-level spell, plus 1d6 for her sneak attack damage).<br>This feat does not allow you to deliver critical hits or sneak attacks against constructs or undead.

Thus, you could use the countersong as a reaction to a sonic or language-dependent magical attack.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can ward off creatures of the aberration type. You make a Charisma check and consult Table 8 -9:Turning Undead on page 159 of the Player&apos;s Handbook, using your druid level to determine the most powerful aberration you can affect. This ability works only against aberrations within 60 feet of you. You then roll 2d6 and add your druid level +your Cha modifier to determine your turning damage. An affected aberration is held at bay, unable to move toward you for as long as you maintain concentration. The aberration&apos;s actions are not otherwise restricted:It can fight other creatures, use its supernatural or spell-like abilities, and attack you with ranged weapons. If you move closer to it, nothing happens. (The creature is not forced back. )The creature is free to make melee attacks against you if you come within reach. If a warded aberration moves away from you and then tries to turn back toward you, it can&apos;t move any closer. <br>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +your Cha modifier. The Extra Turning feat grants you extra uses of this ability.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Lizardfolk, Con 16, Great Fortitude.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Lizardfolk with this feat regain hit points from normal healing t double the normal rate.

This ability oes not allow a lizardfolk to regenerate or reattach lost limbs.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: A full night&apos;s rest normally only restores 1 hit point per character level or Hit Die, while complete bed rest usually only restores 2 hit points per character level or Hit Die.

        <p>You can use your Knowledge skills to extract information from books, scrolls, and other repositories of facts and figures. 
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This feat expands the way you can use the Knowledge skills. It allows you to use a Knowledge skill to navigate a library, an office filing system, a chronicler&apos;s repository, or a church&apos;s records storage cell in order to discover information. You must be able to read the language the texts are written in to research them. <br> <strong>Research a Topic</strong>: Given enough time (usually 1d4 hours, though the DM can increase the time based on the amount of material you&apos;re examining)and a successful DG 10 skill check, you gain a general understanding of the topic you&apos;re researching. This assumes the information you are seeking exists within the collection of materials you are researching. The higher the check result, the better and more detailed the information (to the extent available within the source material). <br>When you want to find out specific information on a specific topic, you must first find a library with tomes relating to that topic. The quality of the library or collection can provide a circumstance bonus on your Knowledge check when performing research. <br>General-purpose libraries (such as those found in some wealthy households, small churches, or towns) contain basic information on a variety of topics and provide a +1 circumstance bonus. <br>A library devoted to a specific topic (usually owned by churches or organizations devoted to specific pursuits) provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Knowledge checks related to its topic. Comprehensive collections are harder to find, but they provide a +4 circumstance bonus. Such collections reside with large churches, in some larger cities, in some organizations and institutions, at Morgrave University, and in major chronicle offices. Even rarer and harder to gain access to are master collections, which provide a +6 circumstance bonus. Master collections are found in a few dragonmarked house enclaves, one or two royal libraries, and in the library at Korranberg. <br><strong>Examine Records</strong>: Examining books or records to get a general sense of what&apos;s in them takes time, skill, and some luck. Find a stack of ledgers in the alchemist&apos;s lab? Discover records in the crime lord&apos;s hideout? Locate the files pertaining to taxes collected in the city? To get a general sense of the information contained therein and whether or not you can use it, you must make a research check using the most appropriate Knowledge skill. The DC depends on the complexity of the code or filing system used. </p><table class="table" style="width:30em"><tr><td>Complexity of Code</td><td>Knowledge DC</td><td>Time Needed</td></tr><tr><td>Basic</td><td>10</td><td>1d4 hours</td></tr><tr><td>Simple</td><td>15</td><td>1d4 +1 hours</td></tr><tr><td>Moderate</td><td>20</td><td>1d4+2 hours</td></tr><tr><td>Complex</td><td>30</td><td>1d4 +4 hours</td></tr></table><p><strong>Mark of Passage</strong>: On any successful check, the higher the result, the better and more complete the information you glean. If you start out seeking a specific fact, date, map, or similar bit of information, the DM might increase the DC by as little as +5 or as much as +15. You can retry a Knowledge check made to perform research, though if the material you are examining doesn&apos;t contain the data you seek, you can&apos;t find it. You can take 10 or take 20 when making a Knowledge check to research a topic or examine records. This use of the Knowledge skill takes a minimum of 1d4 hours.

        <p>You can use the lingering energy from a spell you cast to boost the effect of a later spell.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spellcraft 12 ranks, any metamagic feat.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The Residual Magic feat allows the use of two tactical maneuvers.<br><em>Enduring Potency</em>: If you cast a spell from your daily allotment of spells, then cast the same spell from a scroll or wand in the next round, you can treat the second casting as if it had come from your daily allotment of spells for the purpose of caster level, save DC, and any other effect of the spell.<br><em>Lingering Metamagic</em>: If you cast a spell affected by one or more metamagic feats, and then cast the same spell in the next round, you can apply any one of the metamagic effects from the first casting to the second casting, but without any change to the spell&apos;s level. The second spell doesn&apos;t count as being affected by a metamagic feat for the purpose of this benefit (that is, it doesn&apos;t entitle you to apply the metamagic feat to a spell you might cast in the following round). Only spells you cast using your own metamagic feats (as opposed to metamagic effects from magic items) allow this option to function.

        <p>Sometimes spells cast at you rebound on the caster instead.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Exposure to <em>spell resistance</em> or <em>spell turning</em> spell.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: If you roll a natural 20 on a save against a targeted spell, it turns back on the caster as if affected by a <em>spell turning</em> spell. Unlike spell turning, however, the Residual Rebound feat potentially functions against touch range spells as well. Residual Rebound only works on targeted spells that allow a saving throw, so a <em>fireball</em> won&apos;t rebound, nor will a <em>power word stun</em>.

        <p>Taking damage drives you to greater heights of combat prowess.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: For every 5 points of damage you take from a single creature in one round, you gain a cumulative +1 bonus on damage rolls against that target on your next attack. For example, a monster deals 13 points of damage to a fighter with this feat in one round; in the next round the fighter successfully hits the monster and deals +2 additional points of damage against that monster. If the fighter gets multiple attacks in a round, the bonus damage only counts for the first attack (and only if that attack hits).<br>Bonus damage provided by this feat does not stack from round to round and only applies to your next attack. If you gain bonus damage from Retribution but you miss your target, you also lose the bonus damage provided by this feat. This feat&apos;s bonus damage only applies against the creature that dealt you damage, whether from melee or ranged attacks, spells, special attacks, or any other form. The bonus damage cannot be used to deal extra damage to creatures other than your attacker. In the case of attacks where you cannot conclusively discern from whom or what the attack came, you gain no bonus damage.

        <p>You can keep a spell in reserve to use when a foe causes you harm.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you cast a spell modified by this metamagic feat, the spell has no immediate effect. Any time you are dealt damage by a melee attack during the next 24 hours (or until you next prepare or ready your spells), you can choose to cast the spell on that attacker as an immediate action. Once activated, a retributive spell disappears (it can only affect one attacker).<br>You can apply this feat only to a spell that targets a creature. A retributive spell can target only the attacker that triggered it, even if the spell would normally allow you to target multiple creatures.<br>You can have only one retributive spell cast at a time. Casting a second retributive spell cancels the first (eliminating it with no effect). If you 3 prepare or ready spells while you have a retributive spell cast, the spell dissipates with no effect.<br>A retributive spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: By using the Chain Link or Upgrade Power feats, you can manifest any power that you have previously &quot;forgotten.&quot; Manifestation of a power in this way costs +1 power point on top of its normal cost. Powers forgotten but available through use of this feat do not count as powers that you know or can manifest for the purpose of satisfying requirements of prestige classes, items, or other feats. To manifest the power, you must meet all ability requirements.<br><strong>Note</strong>: This feat requires you to keep track of any &quot;forgotten&quot; powers adding a small amount of extra paperwork.

You automatically win an opposed Strength check when an opponent attempts to bull rush or trip you. A creature with the improved grab ability must move into your space to grapple you, since it cannot pull you into its space. If you are grappling, you automatically win an opposed grapple check when an opponent tries to move you. No spell or other effect can force you to move. If you become frightened or panicked, you experience the full effect of the fear but do not run away. You cannot move, even to make a 5-foot step, while this ability is in effect. This ability lasts for a number of rounds equal to your character level, but you can end it at any rime as a free action.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You must be touching the ground to use this feat.

If she scores a critical hit on her second attack, she can make an additional attack using her +6 base attack bonus. She then makes her third attack (at +1) as normal.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: A spellcaster applying this augmentation bestows an Intelligence score upon his creation equal to 1/2 his caster level. In addition to being able to make judgments and decisions as any other creature with a similar Intelligence score, the construct gains feats and skill points befitting an intelligent construct of its Hit Dice (see page 301 of the Monster Manual for information on how to determine and distribute monstrous feats and skills). This augmentation cannot add additional Intelligence to a construct that normally has an Intelligence score. A golem that gains intelligence in this manner is still bound to the will of its creator as normal.<br>A clay golem with rudimentary intelligence costs 48,000 gp and requires a spellcaster to spend 48 days, 29,500 gp, and 1,920 XP to create. Such a golem gains an Intelligence score of 6, four feats, and 14 skill points.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can use one of your move actions to run across less than solid surfaces including air. This movement can be taken only in a straight line, and it must begin and end on a solid surface. If it doesn&apos;t, you fall into whatever you were running across. The maximum increase or decrease in elevation cannot exceed half your movement rate, and this elevation change counts against the total distance of your movement. For example, a psychic warrior with a movement rate of 40 could run at an angle to put her at the top of a 20-foot wall 20 feet away or the bottom of a 20-foot ravine 20 feet away. If you run across a surface that causes damage, such as lava, you are still subject to damage as normal.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: 4 ranks in Craft (rune)
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can make runes that take the place of traditional material components for spells you cast. The runes, often carved into stone talismans or stamped onto small plates of metal, cost 1 gp each and have a Craft (rune) DC of 15. Unlike a material component, a rune does not disappear when you cast a spell; having this feat effectively turns a material component required for a spell into a focus.<br>Your use of runes makes your spells more difficult to counterspell. Other spellcasters who observe you casting a spell take a -4 penalty on checks to determine which spell you&apos;re casting, unless they also have the Runesmith feat.<br>Spells with costly material components are unaffected by this feat.

Essentially, you can substitute your Ride check result for your..Reflex save if the former is higher.) You can attempt this substitution once per round for either yourself or your mount. If both you and your mount fail a Reflex save against the same effect (for example, a <em>fireball</em> spell or dragon breath that catches you and your mount in its area), your Ride check result applies to both your save and your mount&apos;s save.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You may have only one regional feat.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: A <em>sanctum</em> spell has an effective spell level higher than its normal level if cast in your sanctum (see below), but if not cast in the sanctum, the spell has an effective spell level 1 lower than normal. All effects dependent on spell level (including save DCs) are calculated according to the adjusted level.<br>A <em>sanctum</em> spell uses a spell slot of the spell&apos;s normal level.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Your sanctum is a particular site, building, or structure previously designated by you, and no larger than 20 feet/level in diameter.

        <p>You are particularly adept at moving over sand.
            <br><strong>Region</strong>: Wastes
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You treat shallow sand as normal terrain and deep sand as shallow sand. Sand crust does not break beneath your feet, allowing you to move atop it as if it were normal terrain.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: This feat can be taken twice, allowing a creature to treat all sand as normal terrain. Its effects also stack similarly with other abilities that improve movement over sand. For example, if a bhuka takes Sandskimmer, she treats all sand as normal terrain and never breaks through sand crust by moving across it.

Light and dense rubble and undergrowth in other regions still hinders you, and heavy undergrowth hinders you normally.<br>In addition, when you enter a square of light undergrowth in desert terrain, you need only use 1 square of movement.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Light rubble and light undergrowth raises the DC of Balance and Tumble checks by +2. Dense rubble raises the DC of Balance and Tumble checks by +5 and Move Silently checks by +2.<br>You must use 2 squares of movement to enter a square with light undergrowth.

        <p>Like the scorpion, you can grab and hold your prey.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Str 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, Improved Grapple.
            <br><strong>Region</strong>: Wastes
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: If your attack with an unarmed strike or a light or one-handed melee weapon hits, the strike deals normal damage and you can attempt to start a grapple as a free action; no initial touch attack is required. If you succeed in starting the grapple, you must drop your one-handed weapon, but if you started the grapple with a light weapon, you can use it in each round to make an attack against the creature you are grappling without taking the normal -4 penalty on the attack roll. If you initiated the grapple while armed, however, you cannot make additional grapple checks to deal damage during the round in which you use this feat.<br>You have the option to conduct the grapple normally, or you may hold a creature one or more sizes smaller than you with your off hand. If you choose to do the latter, you take a -20 penalty on grapple checks against that creature and you cannot deal damage with your grapple checks, but you are not considered grappled yourself. You don&apos;t lose your Dexterity bonus to AC, you still threaten an area, and you can use remaining attacks against other opponents. While maintaining this latter type of hold, you can move normally (possibly carrying your opponent away), provided you can drag the opponent&apos;s weight.

            <br><strong>Region</strong>: Wastes
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You have an inborn sense of where to lurk without being seen, gaining a +2 bonus on your Hide checks and reducing the distance within which creatures can detect you by scent to 10 feet (20 feet if upwind, 5 feet if downwind). If you are in an area covered in a layer of at least 1 inch of ash, dust, loose earth, or sand, you gain an additional +2 bonus on Hide checks, a +2 bonus on Move Silently checks, and a creature can detect you by scent only if it is within 5 feet (pinpointing your location as normal).

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Scorpion&apos;s Resolve.
            <br><strong>Region</strong>: Wastes
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You are sensitive to vibrations in the ground and can automatically pinpoint the location of anything that is moving and in contact with the ground so long as it is within 10 feet. The range expands to 20 feet if you are in an area covered in a layer of at least 1 inch of ash, dust, loose earth, or sand. This ability only tells you what square the creature is in, so you still have the normal miss chance from concealment if you cannot see the creature.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Cha 15, Intimidate 5 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can make an Intimidate check to daunt the captain of another ship who can see you or your distinctive colors (see the rules on page 25, <strong>Stormwrack</strong>, for sighting another ship). This is opposed by the target character&apos;s modified level check (see <a href="../../charbuild/skills/intimidate.shtml">Intimidate</a>). If you succeed on the Intimidate check, the target is frightened for as long as it remains able to see you and for 1d6x10 minutes afterward. A frightened character takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks, and tries to flee from you as best it can. If escape is impossible (for example, due to ship damage or the loss of sails), that character will strike the ship&apos;s colors and surrender.<br>Even if you fail the check, the target might become shaken unless you fail by 5 or more. This effect lasts as long as the daunting effect.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Survival 4 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: While trailblazing (see page 103 of Complete Adventurer), you gain a +3 bonus on Survival checks. In addition, as a full-round action you can grant a +1 bonus on all Hide and Move Silently checks made by allies within 20 feet.

        <p>Your slippery ways allow you to evade a damaging blow.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Dex 15, Small size or smaller, improved evasion.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The effects of this feat resemble those of the rogue&apos;s defensive roll, but you can use Scramble to avoid a potentially fatal attack entirely. Once per day, when you would be reduced to 0 hit points or less by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), you can attempt to scramble our of the way. This requires a Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + damage dealt). If the save is successful, you avoid the damage entirely. You must be aware of the attack and able to react to it; you cannot use Scramble if you are denied your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Since you cannot normally make a saving throw to avoid the damage from a blow, improved evasion does not apply. That is, you cannot save twice against the same attack.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Handle Animal 8 ranks, Bonded, Dodge, trained pet.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Each round, as a free action, you can direct your pet to launch an especially determined but somewhat haphazard assault upon any one opponent. This causes your pet to take a -2 penalty on all attacks and Armor Class, but it grants you concealment against that foe.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A fighter may select Screen as one of his fighter bonus feats.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can scribe scrolls that exceed the normal limits for such items (as stated in the Epic Level Handbook and in the DUNGEON MASTER&apos;S Guide). For instance, you could scribe a scroll with spells of greater than 9th level, or a scroll with a caster level greater than 20th.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Even this feat does not allow you to scribe a scroll with an epic spell (see Chapter 2 of the Epic Level Handbook). Such magic defies the power of the written word and thus cannot scribed into scroll form.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Crusader or swordsage level 1st.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can infuse the knowledge of any maneuver you know into a martial script (see Martial Scripts, page 147 of Tome of Battle).</p><p>The market price of a martial script is equal to the initiator level x maneuver level x 50 gp.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spellcaster level 1st
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can create a scroll of any spell that you know. Scribing a scroll takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of its spell level is its spell multiplied by its caster level multiplied by 25 gp. To scribe a scroll, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing half of this base price. Any scroll that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when scribing the scroll.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can create a psionic tattoo of any power of 3rd level or lower that you know and that targets one or more creatures. Scribing a psionic tattoo takes one day. When you create a psionic tattoo, you set the manifester level. The manifester level must be sufficient to manifest the power in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a psionic tattoo is its power level x its manifester level x 50 gp. To scribe a tattoo, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials (special inks, masterwork needles, and so on) costing one-half of this base price.<br>When you create a psionic tattoo, you make any choices that you would normally make when manifesting the power. When its wearer physically activates the tattoo, the wearer is the target of the power.<br>Any psionic tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost.

        <p>One of your ancestors served as a slave of the yuan-ti. Over the course of years, the constant exposure to serpentine magic and blood warped your ancestor, putting just a trace of snake blood into your family line. Your physical characteristics might vary with the type of snake from which you are descended, but you&apos;re likely to have yellow or black eyes and patches of scaly skin.<br>Viper-blooded characters tend to have sharp, angular features with narrow jaws; they generally speak quickly and have a sharp wit. Descendants of cobras tend to have wide, thick necks and hair that grows out from the sides of their heads; they generally prefer solitude, but when in the company of others they possess a commanding presence. Creatures with a constrictor ancestor often have strong, thick bodies and limbs; they tend to take their time even in dangerous situations but they become an unstoppable foes once they finally decide to act. Rattler-blooded characters tend to have a tough, worldly look; they like to dress in bright colors, especially reds and yellows, and are usually quite vocal about their abilities and intent.<br>Sorcerers with serpentine blood prefer spells that intimidate a or end a fight quickly.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation.

This restriction does not apply if she learned any of these spells as a member of another spellcasting class.<br>Because serpents must forever crawl on their bellies, even their offspring cannot hope to look to the skies. Characters with this feat cannot learn or cast spells intended to allow them to leave the ground (such as <em>fly, levitate</em>, or <em>overland flight</em>), and all such spells are removed from the spell lists of all their spellcasting classes.

        <p>You keep alive the worship of a deity who has died or vanished. Your faith in this fallen deity allows you to wield divine magic in his or her name.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Cleric level 1st, dead or forgotten god (for example, Amaunator, Bhaal, Moander, or Myrkul) as patron deity.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can name a dead god as your patron deity and still receive your cleric spells normally. In addition, you can call upon the universal remnant of your deity&apos;s power once per day to gain a +1 luck bonus on any single die roll. You can also be raised or resurrected normally.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can take this feat only once. Choosing this feat changes your patron from your previous deity to the dead or forgotten deity of your choice, and you take no penalties for making this change. If you later choose a different patron deity, you lose the benefit of this feat, but your new patron may grant you spells just as he or she would for any other cleric.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Dead or fallen deities cannot grant cleric spells, so clerics who choose such patrons do not normally receive spells. Characters who do not worship active gods in Faer&#xFB;n suffer the fate of the Faithless in the Fugue Plane after death. <br>See Ancient Deities, page 41, Ancient Empires of Faer&#xFB;n, for a list of notable dead gods, their alignments, and their domains.

If you then visit a third planar touchstone and fulfill its recharge condition, unless you have taken this feat three times, you must choose which of your two previous touchstone site abilities to lose when you gain the abilities of the third touchstone site.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can shape available ectoplasm into a facsimile of nonliving material, such as clothing, rope, leather, or wood. For example, you could make a suit of leather armor out of ectoplasm and it would function exactly like normal leather armor (buckles, buttons, and other small parts that would normally be made out of metal are instead made of ectoplasmic wood but are sufficient for this purpose). It takes 1 full round per pound of weight of the object to craft it, so a suit of ectoplasmic leather armor takes 15 rounds to shape. You must make an appropriate Craft check to shape articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship (a folding chair, a glass vase, and so on). The material is obviously formed of ectoplasm and lasts for a number of minutes equal to 10 + (10 x your Wisdom bonus). Shaped ectoplasm has all the properties of raw ectoplasm, except that it lasts longer and maintains whatever form you mold it into.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can spend a weekly use of remove disease to use your smite evil ability on any non-good creature that possesses a poisonous or infectious natural attack.

If you smite a creature that does not have the fire subtype, the blast of cold does not manifest and the smite attempt is used up for that day.<br>Remember that creatures with the fire subtype take half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from cold, including the additional damage dealt by this ability.<br>You may swap out any daily uses of a smite ability gained by a character class or cleric domain to smite fiery foes instead.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can use your smite ability (whether smite evil or from some other source) when making a bull rush or overrun attempt. If your smite ability would normally grant a bonus on your attack roll against the target of your bull rush or overrun, you can add this bonus to your Strength check instead. In addition, if you win the opposed cheek to bull rush or overrun the target, you deal damage to the target equal to the bonus the smite would grant on a damage roll against that creature.<br>You must announce the smite attempt before starting the bull rush or overrun. If your smite attempt would not grant a bonus against the iarget of youx bull rush or overrun attempt (for instance, if you used smite evil when bull rushing a non-evil creature), the attempt is wasted to no effect.

        <p>You can channel the energy of a touch spell into a weapon, causing the spell to discharge when you strike an opponent.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Base attack bonus +1, caster level 1st.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can alter a spell with a range of touch to transfer its energy from your hand to a weapon that you hold. The next time you strike an opponent with that weapon, the spell discharges. The target takes the normal damage and effects of a successful attack in addition to the spell&apos;s effect. Once you place a spell into a weapon, you must discharge it within 1 minute, or its energy dissipates harmlessly.<br>You can place a smiting spell on a piece of ammunition or a projectile, such as a sling bullet, an arrow, or a crossbow bolt. In such a case, the spell dissipates if the attack misses. The spell cannot be placed on a bow, crossbow, sling, or similar weapon that uses ammunition.<br>A smiting spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

If you succeed, your opponent takes bite damage and is swallowed.<br>A swallowed creature is considered grappled, while you are not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light piercing or slashing weapon (the amount of damage required to get free is noted on the table below), or it can just try to escape the grapple. If the swallowed creature chooses the latter course, success puts it back in your mouth. Any damage a swallowed creature deals is deducted from your hit points.

        <p>You can quickly and skillfully collect a trophy of your victory over a fallen foe.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: After dealing a creature enough damage to drop it to negative hit points, you can slice or pry off a trophy as a free action. You must be adjacent to the dead or dying creature. The trophy could be a small body part such as a finger or ear. Carving a trophy in this manner requires a light slashing or piercing weapon and deals 1d6 points of damage to the target creature. (A creature with regeneration can regrow the severed body part.) Alternatively, you can take a small item worn or carried by your fallen foe, such as a piece of jewelry, pouch, potion, light weapon, or helmet, in which case the victim takes no damage.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Improved Disarm
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: If you succeed in disarming an opponent and you have a free hand, you can grab the weapon yourself instead of letting it fall. If you can wield that weapon in one hand, you can immediately make a single attack with it, though you suffer the usual penalties for a second attack with an off-hand weapon.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: After a successful disarm attempt, the weapon winds up at the defenders&apos; feet, unless you attempted the disarm attack while unarmed.

        <p>You can grapple more easily with either your claws or bite.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Access to a form with either claws or bite as natural weapons
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: If you hit with a claw or bite attack, you automatically attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If you get hold with a claw on a creature four or more size categories smaller than yourself, you squeeze each round for automatic claw damage. If you get a hold with your claw on a creature three or more size categories smaller than yourself, you automatically deal bite damage each round, or if you do not move and take no other action in combat, you deal double bite damage to the snatched creature. As a free action, you can drop a creature you have snatched, or you can use a standard action to fling it aside. A flung creature travels 10 feet (and takes 1d6 points of damage) for each size category greater than Small that you are. If you fling a creature while you are flying, it suffers either flinging or falling damage, whichever is greater.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Con 13.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: If you add a handful of snow or ice as an additional material component to a spell when you cast it, the spell gains the cold descriptor. This does not actually change the nature of the spell you cast; a fireball cast with this feat still deals fire damage, but since it also carries the cold descriptor, it can be augmented by a number of feats listed in this chapter, such as Cold Focus and Frozen Magic.<br>If you add a handful of snow or ice as an additional material component to a spell when you cast it and that spell already has the cold descriptor, you increase the effective level of the spell being cast by +1.<br>Adding this additional material component requires you to spend a move action immediately before the spell is cast to gather fresh snow or ice from the surrounding environment. This snow or ice can be magically created by a conjuration spell, but no other ice manifested by a spell will do. You may take no other action between gathering the snow or ice and casting the spell.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Bardic music ability, Perform (dance) 6 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: By expending one of your daily uses of bardic music, you may perform a deadly style of combat known as the snowflake wardance. Activating a snowflake wardance is a free action, and once activated, you add your Charisma modifier to your attack rolls with any slashing melee weapon you wield in one hand. This bonus to hit stacks with any bonuses you get from a high Strength score (or Dexterity score, if you are using Weapon Finesse).<br>You cannot use this feat if you are carrying a shield, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load.<br>A snowflake wardance lasts for a number of rounds equal to your ranks in Perform (dance).

Its effects reduce the targets&apos; mobility and make objects more susceptible to damage.<br>Any creature that takes cold damage from a power or spell enhanced by this feat and is in contact with a surface must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. The DC for this save equals the save DC for the spell or power (or the save DC it would otherwise have if no save is allowed). Failure means the creature is frozen to the surface and cannot move until it breaks free with a successful Strength check, which requires a full-round action. The DC of the Strength check is equal to the DC of the spell or power. Success means the creature is not immobilized but can move at only half normal speed for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that are immune to cold or that are not in contact with a surface are immune to the immobilizing effect of this feat but are still subject to the spell&apos;s or power&apos;s damage.<br>All objects caught in the area of a Solid Freeze effect become exceedingly brittle for a number of rounds equal to the ability modifier that applies to the spell or power used (minimum 1 round). During this time, each such object&apos;s hardness is reduced by 5 (minimum 1).<br>To apply Solid Freeze to a spell, the caster must expend 4 power points per spell level. To apply it to a psionic power, the manifester must spend 2 spell levels per power level.

        <p>Your ghost body appears solid and alive.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your ghost body (whether incorporeal or manifested fully) appears solid and alive, although it can also appear like a normal ghost if you choose. Changing from one state to the other is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. As long as you appear solid, you lose your ghost +4 racial bonus on Hide checks.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: A character without this feat has a ghost body that is semitransparent and easily recognizable as a ghost.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Concentration 5 ranks, Spellcraft 5 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When wielding a weapon (or holding an item of comparable size) in one or both hands, you can use that item to trace the somatic component of a spell, rather than using your fingers. This allows you to cast spells with somatic components even while your hands are full or occupied, as long as at least one hand is holding an item of proper size. <br>This feat doesn&apos;t allow you to use somatic components while grappling, regardless of the size of your foe.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you use inspire courage, inspire competence, inspire greatness, or inspire heroics, any bonus granted by your music increases by +1. Thus, a 15th-level bard with this feat grants his allies a +4 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear when he uses inspire courage, rather than the +3 he would normally grant. If he uses inspire greatness, the same bard grants up to three allies 3 bonus Hit Dice, a +3 bonus on attack rolls, and a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves. <br>Also, when you use fascinate, suggestion, or mass suggestion, the saving throw DC increases by 1. If you have the Haunting Melody feat, the saving throw DC for that effect also increases by 1. If you have the Music of Growth feat, the bonus bestowed by that feat increases to +6. If you have the Music of Making feat, the bonus on Craft checks bestowed by that feat increases to +6. If you have the Soothe the Beast feat, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your Perform check to improve the attitude of an animal or magical beast.

        <p>You can add such a powerful dose of necromantic energy to your mind-affecting spells that they function against undead creatures but are useless against all others.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: A mind-affecting spell modified by this feat works normally against intelligent undead creatures. Mindless undead (those without Intelligence scores) are still immune to its effect, and the altered spell has no effect against living creatures or constructs. A song of the dead spell takes up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&apos;s actual level. Note that use of this feat does not make mind-affecting spells affect undead if the spell&apos;s description specifies that the target must be living or a particular creature type (other than undead).<br>Any spells prepared with Song of the Dead become necromancy spells.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Bardic music class feature, Perform 6 ranks. 
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain an ability similar to the wild empathy ability of a druid or ranger. Your music can improve the attitude of an animal. You make a Perform check instead of a Diplomacy check and use the result to determine the animal&apos;s new attitude. The typical domesticated animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use this ability, you must be within 30 feet of the animal. The check takes 1 minute, but it might take longer to actually influence the animal. You can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but you take a -4 penalty on the check.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per day per two spellcaster levels, you can case a divine spell as an arcane spell, or vice versa.

You speak in growls, squawks, chitters, or whatever other sounds such an animal would typically use to communicate with others of its kind.

        <p>You can cast any spell that you drain from a creature&apos;s mind.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Cha 15, energy drain, supernatural ability, Improved Energy Drain, caster level 5th.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: If you bestow a negative level upon a spellcasting creature, and that creature loses a prepared spell, you gain the ability to cast that spell once (as if you had prepared it). Treat the spell&apos;s effect as if it had been cast by the character who prepared it (including caster level, save DC, and so forth). You need not have the requisite ability score to cast the spell (for instance, you need not have an Intelligence of 13 or higher to cast a fireball drained from the mind of a wizard).<br>The spell remains in your mind for up to 1 hour. You can have a maximum number of stolen spells equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1); any spells that you would gain above this number are simply lost.<br>This feat has no effect on spellcasters who don&apos;t prepare spells (such as a sorcerer, who simply loses one spell slot for each negative level bestowed as normal) or who have no spells prepared (such as a fighter, or a wizard who has cast all her spells).

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can spend one of your turn/rebuke undead attempts to cast spontaneously any divine spell you can normally prepare. When you attempt to spell siphon a spell, make a turning check and consult the following table to determine the maximum spell level you can attempt to spell siphon.</p><table class="table" style="width:30em"><tr><td><strong>Turning Check Result</strong></td><td><strong>Highest Level Spell Possible</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1 or lower </td><td>0 level</td></tr><tr><td>2-4</td><td>1st level</td></tr><tr><td>5-7</td><td>2nd level</td></tr><tr><td>8-10</td><td>3rd level</td></tr><tr><td>11-13</td><td>4th level</td></tr><tr><td>14-16</td><td>5th level</td></tr><tr><td>17-19</td><td>6th level</td></tr><tr><td>20-22</td><td>7th level</td></tr><tr><td>23-25</td><td>8th level</td></tr><tr><td>26 or higher</td><td>9th level</td></tr></table><p>Once you determine the highest level spell you can spontaneously cast and have selected which spell you wish to cast, you can cast the spell just as if you had prepared it.

If the spell you siphon has a casting time of a full-round action or longer, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the spell. You can apply metamagic feats to this spell, as long as the spell&apos;s effective level is not greater than the highest level spell possible set by the turning check. Each metamagic feat you apply, however, adds another full-round action to the casting time for the spell.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Arcane spellcaster level 1st.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Due to the unusual appearance of your spells, the DC of any Spellcraft check made to identify a spell you have cast increases by +4.

Nearly any theme is possible; so long as you can describe a visual link for unification. For example, your theme might be &quot;lightning,&quot; &quot;spheres,&quot; or &quot;screaming skulls.&quot; If you choose spheres as your theme, your magic missiles might take the form of glowing spheres of light, and your summoned monsters might emerge from mysterious rainbow-colored globes. If your theme is &quot;lightning,&quot; your haste spell might manifest as a bright green spark that leaps from ally to ally. You can&apos;t use this feat to make your spell manifestations invisible, nor do your spell thematics change the type of damage a spell deals, regardless of its appearance.

If you also had the Rapid Shot feat, you could activate the staff four times as a full-round action.<br>Each activation after the first costs one additional charge from the staff, cumulative. Thus, the second activation in a round costs 2 extra charges, the third activation 3 extra charges, and so forth.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain a +4 bonus on Strength checks to resist being bull rushed or overrun. If you make an attack of opportunity against a creature trampling you, you do not take a -4 penalty. If you attempt a Reflex save to avoid a trample attack, you gain a +4 bonus on that saving throw.<br>If you are mounted, your mount gains all of these bonuses as well.

        <p>You can deliver a wound that hampers an opponent&apos;s movement.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Base attack bonus +6, sneak attack.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: If you deal damage with a melee sneak attack, you can also deliver a wound that limits your foe&apos;s mobility. For 1 round (or until the target is the beneficiary of a DC 15 Heal check or any magical healing that restores at least 1 hit point, whichever comes first), your target is treated as if it were staggered, even if its nonlethal damage doesn&apos;t exactly equal its current hit points. A target can resist this effect by making a successful Fortitude save (DC equal to damage dealt). Multiple staggering strikes on the same creature do not stack. This feat has no effect on creatures not subject to sneak attack damage.

        <p>The allies you summon from a specific plane are tougher than normal.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Cha 13, Spellcraft 5 ranks, Planar Touchstone.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you use a spell or spell-like ability summon a creature native to a plane that has a planar touchstone site to which you have forged a link (see the Planar Touchstone feat), you imbue the creature with exceptional resilience. The creature gains a +4 bonus to its Armor Class and on saving throws for the duration of the summoning effect.<br>Furthermore, the duration of the summoning effect that brought the creature is doubled. (Effects with a duration of concentration, instantaneous, or permanent are not affected.)<br>For example, a cleric who has used his Planar Touchstone feat to forge a link between himself and Empyrea Mere touchstone located on the Seven Mounting Heavens Celestia) grants these bonuses to any creature he summons from Celestia, such as a hound archon.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If a creature&apos;s indicated environment doesn&apos;t specify a particular home plane, but rather a group of related planes (such as &quot;any good-aligned plane&quot;), you may choose to summon a creature of that kind that native to your chosen plane and thus apply the feat&apos;s effect normally. However, no component of the alignment of the creature to be summoned may be opposed to any alignment traits of your chosen plane for the feat to work.<br>For instance, the cleric in the example above could apply the feat&apos;s effect to a summoned celestial black bear (lawful good) or a celestial bison (neutral good) since celestial creatures have an environment of &quot;an good-aligned plane.&quot; He couldn&apos;t apply it to a summon celestial lion (chaotic good), since the lion&apos;s alignment has at least one component (chaotic) that is opposed the alignment traits of the Seven Mounting Heavens Celestia (lawful).

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Combat Reflexes, Hindering Opportunist, base attack bonus +9.

        <p>You can prevent foes from fleeing or closing.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Str 13.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When a foe&apos;s movement out of a square you threaten grants you an attack of opportunity, you can give up that attack and instead attempt to stop your foe in his tracks. Make your attack of opportunity normally. If you hit your foe, he must succeed on a Reflex save against a DC of 10 + your damage roll (the opponent does not actually take damage), or immediately halt as if he had used up his move actions for the round.<br>Since you use the Stand Still feat in place of your attack of opportunity, you can do so only a number of times per round equal to the number of times per round you could make an attack of opportunity (normally just one).

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Nimbus of Light.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can heal the wounds and ailments of others using your own life energy When you activate this ability, as a free action, you immediately take at least 2 points of temporary Constitution damage. You can take as many points of constitution damage as you wish, as long as you remain alive and conscious.<br>Once you have activated your stigmata, you can touch your allies to heal them of 1 point of damage per level they possess for every 2 points of Constitution damage you take. In addition any character you touch who is suffering from a disease can immediately make a new saving throw against that disease with a sacred bonus equal to the number of points of Constitution damage you took. If the character succeeds on that saving throw, she is freed from the disease.<br>You can use this touch on one ally per point of Constitution damage you take. As with delivering a touch spell, you can touch up to six allies as a full-round action. A single person cast only benefit once from each activation of your stigmata, but each activation lasts for 1 hour.<br>For example, if you sacrifice 4 points of Constitution, you can grant four allies a number of hit points of healing equal to twice their level. Each ally who was suffering from a disease would make a new saving throw with a +4 sacred bonus. If only two of your allies were wounded at the time you activated the stigmata, you could &quot;save&quot; the other two uses for up to 1 hour, in case other characters become wounded within that time. Even if the characters you originally healed were injured again, however, they could not benefit from the same activation of your stigmata.<br>When you use this ability the wounds on your body bleed it proportion to the Constitution damage you take. The bleeding persists for 1 hour, and the Constitution damage cannot be restored by any means until the bleeding has stopped. Once the bleeding has stopped, you can freely activate the stigmata again whether or not you have recovered your lost Constitution, as long as you have enough Constitution left to use the ability and survive.

        <p>You can cast mysteries without gestures.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: A stilled mystery can be cast with no somatic components. This also prevents your shadow from making gestures that differ from your own during casting.

        <p>When you are ready and able to acquire anew familiar, you may choose to gain a stitched flesh familiar.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to acquire a new familiar, ability to cast three or more necromancy spells.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When choosing a familiar, you may choose a stitched flesh familiar. A stitched flesh familiar appears similar to any of the standard familiars available in the Player&apos;s Handbook, except that the stitched flesh familiar is obviously sewn together from many different creatures of that kind and, to a practiced eye is clearly an undead creature.<br>A stitched flesh familiar is magically linked to its master in the same way as a normal familiar. A stitched flesh familiar uses the basic statistics for a creature of its kind, as given in the Monster Manual, except as noted below.<br><em>Hit Dice</em>: A stitched flesh familiar has a d12 Hit Die and gains no bonus hit points from Constitution (since it is an undead creature). For effects that depend upon Hit Dice, use the master&apos;s character level or the familiar&apos;s normal Hit Dice total, whichever is higher.<br><em>Hit Points</em>: Use 1/2 the master&apos;s total or the familiar&apos;s normal total, whichever is higher.<br><em>Attacks</em>: Use the master&apos;s base attack bonus or the familiar&apos;s, whichever is higher.<br><em>Saving Throws</em>: For each saving throw, use either the familiar&apos;s base save bonus or the master&apos;s (as calculated from his character level), whichever is higher.<br><em>Familiar Special Abilities</em>: Use the second table in the Familiars sidebar on page 52 of the Player&apos;s Handbook to determine additional abilities, just as you would for a normal familiar. Stitched flesh familiars do not grant their masters any of the benefits that appear on the first table in that sidebar. Instead of the noted special ability, a stitched flesh familiar grants its master the ability to control 4 more Hit Dice of undead than he is normally capable of controlling (both through the rebuke undead ability and through spells such as animate dead).

Your natural armor bonus becomes +4 (replacing any natural armor bonus you normally have, though you retain any enhancement bonus to natural armor).<br>You also gain a slam attack that deals bludgeoning damage equal to a morningstar appropriate to your size (2d6 points for Large characters, 1d8 points for Medium characters, 1d6 points for Small characters).

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Wis 15, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: With a successful grapple check, you can try to partially disable one of your opponent&apos;s arms or legs by gripping and twisting it. An opponent subjected to this attack must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) or take a -2 penalty on all rolls and checks made for actions involving that limb for 1d6+1 rounds. Furthermore, all forms of movement involving that limb are reduced by 5 feet (minimum 0 feet). No limb can be affected more than once. This attack counts as one of the possible options you can use while grappling (see Grapple in Chapter 8 of the Player&apos;s Handbook) and affects the creature if you succeed at a grapple check.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you use an attack action or a full attack action, or you initiate a Stone Dragon strike in melee combat, you can take a penalty of as much as -5 on your attack roll. This number cannot exceed your base attack bonus. You gain temporary hit points equal to twice the number that you subtract from your attack rolls (to a maximum of +10). These temporary hit points last until the beginning of your next turn.

The target of a stygian power can attempt a Will save at the power&apos;s save DC (even if it doesn&apos;t normally allow a save) to resist this effect. This is a mind-affecting fear ability. Creatures immune to fear are not immune to the primary effect of the power, but they are immune to the shaken effect.<br>Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: By expending uses of your bardic music, you can heighten your illusion spells without using higher-level spell slots. For every daily use of your bardic music you expend during the casting of a spell, you can increase the effective level of that spell by +1. For example, you could cast <em>rainbow pattern</em> and expend four uses of your bardic music to make that <em>rainbow pattern</em> effectively an 8th-level spell (increasing the save DC by +4). You cannot raise a spell above 9th level with this feat.

        <p>You can create tattoos that store spells.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Craft (calligraphy) or Craft (painting) skill, spellcaster level 3rd+
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can create single-use magic tattoos.<br>You can create a tattoo of any spell of 3rd level or lower that you know and that targets a creature or creatures. Creating a tattoo takes 1 hour, and it must be inked onto a creature with a corporeal body. When you create a tattoo, you set the caster level. The caster level must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a tattoo is its spell level X its caster level x 50 gp. To create a tattoo, you must spend 1/25th of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing half this base price.<br>When you create a tattoo, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. The bearer of the tattoo is the only one who can activate it and is always the target of the spell. Activating a tattoo requires the creature to touch the tattoo with either hand (the hand does not need to be empty). Activating a tattoo is a standard action that does not draw an attack of opportunity.<br>Any tattoo that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when creating the tattoo.<br>Normally, a magic tattoo uses a magic item space on the creature&apos;s body. For example, a creature with a tattoo on one of its hands could not gain the benefit from a magic glove on that hand. Likewise, a creature with a magic tattoo on its back does not receive the benefits of a magic cloak, cape, or mantle. In effect, the magic tattoo is always the first item &quot;worn&quot; on that part of the body, negating the effects of all other items. A tattoo can be created that does not use a magic item space, but the base price of such a tattoo is double the normal value.<br>A magic tattoo can be erased with an <em>erase</em> spell as if it were magic writing. Failing to erase the tattoo does not activate it. When a tattoo is activated, the ink pattern or design vanishes from the bearer&apos;s skin.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You may gain <a href="../../magic/items/implants.shtml">technomagical implants</a>. Minor implants are small colored disks or chips of metal usually no more than a couple inches long, with tiny, barely visible inner workings of gears and springs. Minor implants install directly beneath the skin, requiring a DC 20 Spot check to notice them (implants concealed by clothing or armor cannot be seen in this way).<br>A major implant is a colored disk or rod of metal usually no more than a foot long, with tiny, barely visible inner workings of gears and springs. A major implant installs into your flesh (usually with some part of it protruding from the skin), requiring a DC 10 Spot check to notice it (an implant concealed by clothing or armor cannot be seen in this way).<br>Because of its size and potency, a technomagical implant takes up a body slot as a magic item of the appropriate type. All implants, minor and major, are compatible with each other and their bonuses stack where applicable.<br>The ability to create the technology found in implants no longer exists among the mortal races of the world, so the only way to acquire them is as treasure (hence their gp values). Note that taking this feat does not grant you possession of any implants. You must find them as a part of treasure.<br>You may install as many technomagical implants as you can find, as long as you do not violate the rules governing magic item slots.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A monk may gain Technomagical Implant as her 6th-level monk bonus feat.

For example, you could make a suit of half-plate out of ectoplasm and it would function exactly like normal half-plate. It takes 1 full round per pound of weight of the object to craft it, so a suit of ectoplasmic half-plate takes 50 rounds (5 minutes) to shape.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You may, as a full-round action, clap two of your limbs together and create a cone of sound that starts at your position and continues our for a number of feet equal to 5 x your Hit Dice. A storm giant using this feat creates a cone 95 feet (5 x 19 Hit Dice) long. Creatures in the cone get a Fortitude save (DC 10 - 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Con modifier) to resist the effect. Those who fail their save are deafened for the duration of the encounter. Those who fail their save by 5 or more are also knocked down.

        <p>One of your attack forms that normally deals ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain can also deal corruption or depravity.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Natural attack that deals ability damage (including poison), ability drain, or energy drain.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one of your natural attacks that deals ability damage or ability drain or bestows negative levels. That attack now increases the target&apos;s corruption or depravity score by 1 point along with the ability damage or drain it deals. If your attack deals ability damage or drain to a physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), it now also increases the target&apos;s corruption score. If the attack deals ability damage or drain to a mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma), it now also increases the target&apos;s depravity score. If the attack bestows negative levels, you can choose whether it increases a specific target&apos;s corruption or depravity score.<br>If the attack you choose bestows more than one negative level, it now increases the target&apos;s taint score by 2 points. You can choose to have it increase a target&apos;s corruption by 2 points, increase a target&apos;s depravity by 2 points, or increase each score by 1 point.

        <p>You are connected to the intangible threads of existence that lie beyond the Material Plane.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Cha 13.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Something about you makes it difficult for incorporeal creatures to see you clearly. When on the Material Plane, you have concealment from incorporeal creatures (20% miss chance).<br><em>See invisibility</em> does not counteract this effect, but <em>true seeing</em> does.<br>An incorporeal creature that cannot see the subject ignores this effect (although fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own - see page 151 <strong>PH</strong>).<br>This feat has no effect on corporeal or ethereal creatures.

        <p>You forge a link with a power-rich location, referred to as a touchstone site.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Knowledge (local) 8 ranks for the area in which the touchstone lies, or possession of a touchstone key (a portable object native to the touchstone&apos;s area and worth at least 250 gp). To forge a link between yourself and the touchstone, you must spend a day in meditation, spending 10 XP and 250 gp in material components. Alternatively, the key object for the touchstone can be destroyed as part of the ritual, in place of the material components.
            <br><strong>Region</strong>: Wastes
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain the base ability associated with the touchstone to which you are linked. If you physically visit the location to which you have forged a link, you can also gain a higher-order ability with a limited number of uses, as described for that touchstone. You can swap sites any time you visit a new one and fulfill its higher-order recharge condition. See Touchstone Sites, <em>Sandstorm</em>, for more information.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can take this feat more than once. Each time you do, you are able to retain one more touchstone site&apos;s base ability. You also gain the capacity to retain uses of one more touchstone&apos;s higher-order ability. Thus, by taking this feat twice, you could retain the base abilities for both the Shrine at Kahar and the Sunken City of Pazar simultaneously, as well as both sites&apos; higher-order abilities and uses. If you then visit a third touchstone site and fulfill its recharge condition, unless you have taken this feat three times, you must choose which of your two previous touchstone site abilities to lose as you gain the abilities of the new touchstone site.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you cast a transmutation spell, you can choose to grant yourself or any one creature targeted by the spell damage reduction 5/magic. If the creature already has damage reduction (of any type) from another source, you increase that damage reduction by 5 instead. This effect lasts for 1 round.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Aboleth, Con 22, Enlarge Mucus Cloud, Thicken Mucus.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Any creature that comes in contact with the mucus cloud becomes poisoned. The creature must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + half the aboleth&apos;s Hit Dice + Con modifier) or take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. One minute later, the creature must save again against the same DC or take another 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. Creatures that remain in the mucus cloud for multiple rounds must make additional saving throws each round.<br>Aboleths, skum, and creatures transformed by an aboleth&apos;s slime attack are immune to the effect of Toxic Mucus and can move through the cloud without penalty.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: When on land, this ability affects only nonaboleth (or non transformed creatures) that walk through the mucus puddle; flying creatures are not affected.<br>An aboleth must replenish its mucus constantly to maintain the poisonous qualities. Samples taken from the aboleth retain their toxic qualities for only 1 minute.

        <p>You can follow the trails of creatures and characters across most types of terrain.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: To find tracks or to follow them for one mile requires a Survival check. You must make another Survival check every time the tracks become difficult to follow, such as when other tracks cross them or when the tracks backtrack and diverge.<br>You move at half your normal speed (or at your normal speed with a -5 penalty on the check). The DC depends on the surface and the prevailing conditions: (Very soft -5; Firm -15; Soft -10; Hard -20)<br><em>Very Soft Ground</em>: Any surface (fresh snow, thick dust, wet mud) that holds deep, clear impressions of footprints.<br><em>Soft Ground</em>: Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but firmer than wet mud or fresh snow, in which the creature leaves frequent but shallow footprints.<br><em>Firm Ground</em>: Most normal outdoor surfaces (such as lawns, fields, woods, and the like) or exceptionally soft or dirty indoor surfaces (thick rugs, very dirty or dusty floors). The creature might leave some traces (broken branches, tufts of hair) but leaves only occasional or partial footprints.<br><em>Hard Ground</em>: Any surface that does not hold footprints at all, such as bare rock or indoor floors. Most stream beds fall into this category, since any footprints left behind are obscured or washed away. The creature leaves only traces (scuff marks, displaced pebbles).
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A ranger receives Track as a bonus feat.</p><p>This feat does not allow you to find or follow the tracks of a subject of a <em>pass without trace</em> spell.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You must expend your psionic focus to manifest a transdimensional power. A transdimensional power has its full normal effect on incorporeal creatures, creatures on the Ethereal Plane or the Plane of Shadow, and creatures within an extradimensional space in the power&apos;s area. This includes ethereal creatures, creatures that are blinking or shadow walking, manifested ghosts, and creatures within the extradimensional space of a rope trick, portable hole, or other portable extradimensional space.<br>You must be able to perceive a creature to target it with a transdimensional power, but you do not need to perceive a creature to catch it in the area of a burst, cone, emanation, or spread.<br>Using this feat does not increase the power point cost of the power.

        <p>You can temporarily transfer one of your legacy item&apos;s abilities to another magic item.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Least Legacy, legacy ability with a daily use limit.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one of your item&apos;s available legacy abilities with a daily use limit.

        <p>You can transfer a touch spell to another creature for delivery.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Only a spell with a range of touch can be transferred with this feat. You cast a transferred spell normally and then touch the creature to whom the spell is to be transferred. That creature is not affected by the spell; instead, one of its empty hands (or a natural attack) is &quot;armed&quot; with the spell as you normally are after casting the spell (including the duration the creature can hold the charge, the number of recipients, and the instances in which the spell is wasted). The spell is discharged with the first successful touch attack or attack the creature makes with that empty hand (or natural attack). The creature does not provoke an attack of opportunity when making the touch attack. Duration and effect remain based on you, the original caster. If you cast another spell, the transferred spell is canceled. A transferred spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

        <p>Your charge is deadly.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ka-tainted (triceratops), base attack +3.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you charge a foe, you may make a gore attack as a secondary natural attack in addition to the normal attack you can make during a charge. If you only attack with a gore during the charge, the gore attack is a primary attack and deals double damage.

        <p>You project a simulacrum of yourself that can perform limited tasks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per day as a standard action, you can create an exact duplicate of yourself up to 30 feet away. You can control this simulacrum&apos;s movements as a free action. The image becomes more &quot;real&quot; as you advance in level. This ability is usable up to a maximum of 1 minute per level each day.<br>The simulacrum combines the characteristics of the silent image(PH 279) and unseen servant (PH 297) spells. Its hit points are equal to 6 + your character level. It ignores terrain effects and moves like an unseen servant, making no noise in the process, though it makes normal motions while traveling. If you have a fly speed, the image appears to fly when not in contact with the ground; otherwise, it walks on open air. You can do anything with this image that you could do with the unseen servant spell and are under the same limitations.<br>When you attain 5th level, you gain more control over the simulacrum. At this point, it behaves more like a major image spell (PH 252), though it still performs actions like an unseen servant. As long as the simulacrum remains within 5 feet of your position (and you can direct it to do so as a free action), you can perform a Bluff check in combat as a swift action. You gain a +4 bonus on this check, which is opposed by your opponents&apos; Sense Motive checks. If you are successful, your foes believe the image is you (and vice versa) for 1 round. <br>Once you reach 10th level, you can spend a swift action to transfer your perceptions to the simulacrum and perceive the world from its point of view rather than your own. You can move the image as if it were your own body, using the simulacrum&apos;s movement characteristics (ignoring terrain, &quot;flying,&quot; and the like). You can also perform any skill and ability checks using the simulacrum, as long as they do not require a Strength score higher than 2. The image has phantom versions of all your equipment (such as lockpicks), but any such items that lose direct contact with it immediately dissipate.<br>When you attain 15th level, the image can become more &quot;real&quot; at your command. It gains a Strength score equal to one-half your own and can perform combat actions using phantom versions of your gear. Any of these items that lose contact with the image dissipate immediately. Thus, the image can wield a sword, but if it shoots a bow, the arrow disappears as soon as it is fired. Equipment that extends more than 5 feet from the image (such as a length of rope) also disappears beyond that distance. In addition, you can now cast spells originating from the image as if with a project image spell (PH 265), with one exception. If you lose line of effect to the image, the effect does not end; you just can&apos;t cast spells originating from the image until you gain line of effect again.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. <br>If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each three daily turn or rebuke uses you expend.

        <p>A belt of minotaur fur, a hood of cloaker wing-skin, and an amulet fashioned from a petrified dragon&apos;s eye - these are the intimidating symbols of your trade. You are skilled in preserving portions of defeated enemies and turning them into trophies. The memory of your past accomplishments drives you onward, instilling in you the confidence needed to face still greater foes.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Craft (taxidermy) 6 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you defeat a foe in combat, you can preserve a part of its body and create a trophy that you can wear or brandish. In order to be worthy of your efforts, the opponent must have a CR greater than your current level. A trophy has a value equal to the defeated creature&apos;s CR x 100 gp. You must spend time using the Craft (taxidermy) skill to create the trophy as normal. Once you create a trophy, you can sell it for its market price or wear it. When you create a trophy, you must design it to occupy space on your body as one of these kinds of magic items: amulet, belt, boots, or cloak. You cannot gain the benefit of both a magic item and a trophy if both occupy the same space on your body; in such a case, the object you donned last becomes functional and the other object does not work.<br>While wearing a trophy, you gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks per trophy against creatures of the same type as the trophy, except for outsiders and humanoids. In these two cases, the target must share the same subtype as the creature from which you crafted the trophy. You take a +4 penalty on Diplomacy checks against creatures of the same type or subtype as one or more of your worn trophies.<br>For each trophy you wear, you gain a +1 bonus on saves against fear effects. Once per day, you gain a morale bonus on a single Will save equal to the number of trophies you wear. In this case, you draw upon the memories of past victories to strengthen your resolve. If you choose to take this morale bonus on a save against a fear effect, it stacks with the usual +1 bonus on saves per trophy worn.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can only craft trophies from corporeal creatures that you actively helped defeat. You cannot craft trophies from oozes.

        <h1>Trophy Hunter</h1>
        <p><strong>Type</strong>: General
            <br><strong>Source:</strong>  Dragon #332<br></p>
        <p>You have turned the destruction of your favored enemy into a ritual act, gaining additional powers against those you hunt through the display or consumption of body parts.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Favored enemy ability.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one of your favored enemies and one of the following trophies. You can use the chosen body part of a chosen favored enemy that you personally kill to temporarily increase your flavored enemy abilities against other members of the chosen favored enemy&apos;s type. The benefits you gain depend on the part of the body you utilize. The body part to be used may be preserved with a <em>gentle repose</em> spell (extending its viability for as long as that spell&apos;s duration), but nonmagical attempts to preserve it ruin it for the purpose of using this feat. All benefits are supernatural mind-affecting effects.<br><strong>Head</strong>: Carrying and openly displaying a severed head of one of your favored enemies allows you to add Intimidate to the list of skills that benefit from your favored enemy ability with an additional +1 morale bonus on the check for each head beyond the first. You can gain this bonus from a maximum of five heads (+4 bonus total). A head lasts for seven days before it begins to rot beyond effectiveness.<br><strong>Heart</strong>: You can consume the strength of a fallen favored enemy by eating its heart. This requires 1 minute and a Fortitude save (DC 10+1/2 HD + Con modifier). In most cases, failure simply means that no benefit comes from eating the heart, although in the case of alien or unnatural creatures it produces additional side effects as noted in the Side Effects sidebar. Creatures without discernible anatomies (such as constructs, oozes, and plants) and undead do not possess viable hearts. A single heart grants you a temporary +2 morale bonus on attack rolls made against your favored enemy for 10 minutes per Hit Die of the creature. Eating additional hearts prolongs the duration of the effect by 5 minutes per Hit Die (up to a maximum of 4 hours), although it does not increase the morale bonus. Hearts must be consumed within 10 minutes of the creature&apos;s death. <br><strong>Token</strong>: You fashion crude jewelry from the bones, eyes, or teeth of your favored enemy. Doing so requires 1 hour and a DC 15 Survival check. Wearing such tokens strengthens your resolve, granting you a +2 morale bonus on Fortitude saves made against spell-like and supernatural attacks of your favored enemy. The token takes up the necklace slot. The token remains effective for a number of days equal to one-half the amount your Survival check exceeded the DC (minimum 1 day).<br><strong>Pelt (scalp or hide)</strong>: The pelt of a favored enemy grants you a +2 morale bonus on all attacks made against creatures of the same type. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until the end of your next encounter with at least one creature of the same type. Taking a scalp or cutting off enough recognizable hide requires 5 minutes + 5 minutes per size category above Medium. You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, you may choose a new trophy and a new favored enemy to apply all your trophy types to.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: <strong>Side Effects</strong><br>If you fail your Fortitude save when consuming the heart of one of the following creatures, suffer the listed side effect.</p><table class="table" style="width:30em"><tr><td>Favored Enemy Type</td><td>Side Effect</td></tr><tr><td>Aberration, magical beast, monstrous humanoid</td><td>Nauseated 1 round/3 HD of creature.</td></tr><tr><td>Dragon</td><td>Sickened 1 round/2 HD of creature.</td></tr><tr><td>Outsider</td><td>Damage of 1 hp/HD of creature.</td></tr></table><p>

        <h1>Truename</h1>
        <p><strong>Type</strong>: General
            <br><strong>Source:</strong>  Dragon #317<br></p>
        <p>You acquire a truename, a secret magic name that affords you power - at a price.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spellcraft 12 ranks, fetish object.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: At any time after taking this feat, you may perform a ritual that establishes your truename, a unique word of power intrinsically linked to your being. You must have 8 hours of uninterrupted time to prepare and perform the ritual, which requires rare material components including expensive incense, inks, gems, parchments and spices worth a total of 5,000 gp. You must possess the item that is your designated fetish. You must also pay 200 XP per Hit Die you possess. The benefits and risks of having a truename are detailed in the Truenames and Fetishes article, Dragon #317.<br>In the event of an interruption of the ritual, the materials are all lost and must be reacquired - including the fetish. No experience points are lost until completion of the ritual. You need not wait until a new feat is gained to attempt a new ritual.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You may have only one truename at any given time, but you may change your truename or rid yourself of any truename. To replace your truename with a new one (or rid yourself of your truename), you pay all the same costs as noted above for acquiring a truename, except as follows: You may use the same fetish or change it to a new one, and the XP cost is 200 XP per HD between your current HD and the HD at which you last acquired a truename. If you don&apos;t have your old fetish, or if your old fetish was destroyed, you must take the Truename feat again before you can complete the ritual that changes your truename or rids yourself of a truename.<br>For example, Falanor the human sorcerer acquires a truename at 12th level and pays 5,000 gp and 2,400 XP. He changes his truename at 15th level by selecting the feat again; he pays another 5,000 gp but pays only 600 XP.<br>There are three major benefits of changing your truename. First, if anyone has learned your truename, or some part of it, that knowledge is now irrelevant. Second, you can choose a new fetish object, which might have been compromised or stolen. Third, the Spellcraft check to identify your truename increases by +5 for each time you take the Truename feat after the first.<br>There is a potential disadvantage as well. Items you created with the old truename are no longer as powerful for you, as they lose the power they had that was associated with the old truename. Of course, they continue to function as normal magic items. You may alter these items to utilize your new truename, but you must spend 1,000 gp and 100 XP per item you wish to affect, and you must do so during the rite you perform to establish your new truename. Furthermore, each item adds 1 hour to the time required to complete the ritual.

        <p>When you move near an opponent, your acrobatic maneuvers leave him confused and unable to properly defend himself.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Bluff 4 ranks, Tumble 4 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a swift action at the start of your turn, you designate a single opponent as the target of this feat If you successfully use your Tumble skill to avoid provoking an attack of opportunity from that opponent, you gain a + bonus on your next Bluff check to feint against him. You must use this benefit on or before your next turn.<br>For example, Lidda designates a nearby ogre as the target of this feat. She tumbles into the ogre&apos;s threatened area and continues to tumble past the creature, moving to a square from which she plans to make a melee attack against the ogre. Lidda succeeds on her Tumble check to avoid provoking an attack of opportunity from the ogre, and she moves into her destination square. She can now use a standard action to feint the ogre, applying the benefit of this feat on her Bluff check, or she can take any other sort of standard action, including making a normal melee attack against the ogre. If she chooses not to feint immediately, she can wait until her next turn and still gain this feat&apos;s benefit.

        <p>You can manifest a power simultaneously with another power just like it.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see <a href="../../charbuild/skills/concentration.shtml#psionics">Concentration skill</a> description). You can twin a power. Manifesting a power altered by this feat causes the power to take effect twice on the area or target, as if you were simultaneously manifesting the same power two times on the same location or target. Any variables in the power (such as duration, number of targets, and so on) are the same for both of the resulting powers. The target experiences all the effects of both powers individually and receives a saving throw (if applicable) for each. In some cases, such as a twinned psionic charm, failing both saving throws results in redundant effects (although, in this example, any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel attempts to free the target from the charm effect).<br>Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6.

        <p>You can simultaneously cast a single spell twice.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any metamagic feat.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Casting a twinned spell causes the spell to take effect twice in the same area or on the same target simultaneously. Any variable characteristics (including attack rolls) or decisions you would make about the spell (including target and area), are applied to both spells, with affected creatures receiving all the effects of each spell individually (including getting two saving throws if applicable).<br>A spell whose effects wouldn&apos;t stack if it was cast twice under normal circumstances will create redundant effects if successfully twinned. For example, a <em>twinned charm person</em> doesn&apos;t create a more potent or long-lasting effect, but any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel attempts in order to free the target from the charm. As with other metamagic feats, twinning a spell does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling, so a single successful counterspell negates both instances of a twinned spell.<br>A twinned spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a standard action, you can vocally order a single undead creature within 30 feet to undertake a specific action, as per the spell <em>command</em>. The undead creature can attempt to resist your order with a successful Will save (DC 10 + your Charisma modifier + your total number of racial feats), but otherwise it must follow your command to the best of its ability.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Charisma 13
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain a +4 bonus on Diplomacy checks made to influence the reactions of intelligent undead. You can also use Diplomacy to influence the actions of mindless undead, though in this case you do not gain the +4 bonus on your check. Generally, mindless undead begin an encounter with a hostile attitude; a Diplomacy check sufficient to make them indifferent is usually enough to stave off attack. If the undead have been specifically commanded to guard something, a Diplomacy check sufficient to make them friendly is required to make them back off from combat, and a check sufficient to make them helpful is needed to make them abandon what they are guarding. <br>To influence the behavior of a mindless undead, the character and the undead must be within 30 feet of one another. Generally, influencing an undead in this way takes 1 minute, but as with influencing the living, it might take more or less time.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Rather than a living creature, your familiar is an undead version of a normal animal. See <a href="../../monsters/types.shtml#Undead">undead special qualities</a>. Note that you cannot convert an existing non-undead familiar to an undead familiar by taking this feat, although if your familiar is slain and you have this feat, you can reanimate your dead familiar with a <em>raise dead</em> spell. Undead familiars tend to be associated with characters of evil alignment, particularly necromancers.<br>Undead familiars can be turned or rebuked. Use the familiar&apos;s effective Hit Dice (see <a href="../../magic/familiars.shtml">About Familiars</a>) for the purposes of turning or rebuking. A familiar fleeing or cowering as the result of a successful turn can&apos;t obey commands from the master (any more than it could while fear struck or paralyzed). Raising a destroyed undead familiar brings it back as a living creature.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The Undermountain Tactics feat enables the use of certain tactical maneuvers, described below.</p><p><em>Stair King</em>: To use this maneuver, you must gain the high ground bonus on your attacks against an opponent. If you hit your foe with two or more melee attacks during your turn, he must make a Balance check (DC 10 + your Str modifier) or be knocked prone. Your opponent can opt to succeed automatically on his Balance check. If he does so, he will lose his move action on his next turn, but he will succeed automatically on Balance checks to resist this maneuver until the start of his next turn. Your opponent must make this choice before seeing the result of his Balance check. You can target a particular creature with this maneuver once per round.</p><p><strong><em>Tunnel Fighter</em></strong>: To use this maneuver, you must be the target of at least one melee attack from at least one foe while standing with walls adjacent to you on two or more sides. When you are attacked under such conditions, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class due to cover. (If you gain cover from another source, this benefit does not stack with it.) You also block line of sight for any spells or attacks made by your opponents, though your allies can fire through your space as normal.</p><p><em>Door Sentinel</em>: To use this maneuver, you must fight defensively while adjacent to or standing in a doorway, a gate, or a similar opening in a wall. You must be adjacent to or standing in each square across the doorway&apos;s width. For 1 round after you fight defensively, you gain a +4 bonus on Strength or Dexterity checks to resist bull rush or trip attacks. Any creature attempting a Tumble check to avoid your attack of opportunity takes a -5 penalty on the check. Any creature attempting to tumble through your space takes a -10 penalty on its check.

        <h1>Up The Walls</h1>
        <p><strong>Type</strong>: Psionic
            <br><strong>Source:</strong>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0786933011/realmshelps-20/">Expanded Psionics Handbook</a><br></p>
        <p>You can run on walls for brief distances.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Wis 13.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: While you are psionically focused, you can take part of one of your move actions to traverse a wall or other relatively smooth vertical surface if you begin and end your move on a horizontal surface. The height you can achieve on the wall is limited only by this movement restriction. If you do not end your move on a horizontal surface, you fall prone, taking falling damage as appropriate for your distance above the ground. Treat the wall as a normal floor for the purpose of measuring your movement. Passing from floor to wall or wall to floor costs no movement; you can change surfaces freely. Opponents on the ground can make attacks of opportunity as you move up the wall.<br>For instance, Ma&apos;varkith the psychic warrior has a speed of 40 feet (due to her Speed of Thought feat). She begins her turn standing next to a wall. She moves up the wall at a 45-degree angle (&quot;diagonally&quot;) for 20 feet, which puts her 15 feet farther along the wall and 15 feet above the ground. Then she moves 15 feet straight down, ending her move in a 5-foot square adjacent to the wall (she has used up 35 feet of her allowed movement). At this point she takes her attack normally against an opponent adjacent to her, which potentially sets up flanking opportunities for her comrades. If the wall had a ledge within 30 feet of the ground, she could have ended her move on the ledge instead of having to move back down to the floor.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can take other move actions in conjunction with moving along a wall. For instance, the Spring Attack feat allows you to make an attack from the wall against a foe standing on the ground who is within the area you threaten; however, if you are somehow prevented from completing your move, you fall. Likewise, you could tumble along the wall to avoid attacks of opportunity.

        <p>You can tap into powers of which you have some knowledge.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Chain Link or Upgrade Power
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per day you may select a power that is in a power chain that has the Upgrade Power or Chain Link feat applied to it. You do not need to have ever known the power. You need to know at least one other power in the specific chain of the chosen power. The power is considered on your list of known powers for 1 day. The power&apos;s level cannot exceed the highest- level power you know minus one. To manifest the power, you must meet all ability requirements. Manifestation of the power costs +2 power points on top of its normal cost.<br><strong>Note</strong>: This feat requires you to keep track of all powers in a chain affected by Chain Link or Upgrade Power so that you can easily choose what power you will be selecting. Chain Link does not automatically allow you to choose any power from your primary discipline; you still need to know at least one other power in the specific chain of the chosen power.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You may take this feat more than once. Each time you take this feat beyond the first grants you an additional power for the duration.

        <p>You can upgrade your powers.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Any other psionic or metapsionic feat
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one power chain from which you have learned a psionic power. When you learn a higher-level power on that chain, you can &quot;forget&quot; one or more lower-level powers you know on the chain, substituting new, different powers of the same lower level instead. If you &quot;forget&quot; a lower-level power and that is the only power you know from your discipline at that level, you must substitute another power from your discipline at that level. You can choose not to &quot;forget&quot; a lower-level power you know, even if learning a higher-level power on a chain for which you have chosen this feat.<br>Recognized power chains are described in Dragon #287, pages 55, 56 - other power chains may be possible (or the recognized power chains may be altered), at your DM&apos;s discretion
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time, it applies to a new power chain.

        <p>You can track down the location of missing persons or wanted individuals within communities.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: To find an individual&apos;s trail, or to follow a trail for 1 hour, requires a Gather Information check. You must make another Gather Information check every hour you search, as well as each time the trail becomes more difficult to follow, such as when it takes you to a different part of town. The DC of the check, and the number of checks required to track down your quarry, depends on on the community size and the prevailing conditions. If you fail a check, you can retry after 1 hour of questioning; the DM should roll the number of checks required secretly, so that the player doesn&apos;t know exactly how much time the task will require. You can cut the time between Gather Information checks in half (from 1 hour to 30 minutes), but you take a -5 penalty on the check. Obviously, this feat will not allow you to locate someone who has gone beyond the boundaries of the community, but it could inform you that they&apos;ve done so.</p><table class="table" style="width:30em"><tr><td>Community Size*</td><td>DC</td><td>Checks Required</td></tr><tr><td>Thorp, hamlet, or village</td><td>5</td><td>1d3</td></tr><tr><td>Small town or large town</td><td>10</td><td>1d4+1</td></tr><tr><td>Small city or large city</td><td>15</td><td>1d6+1</td></tr><tr><td>Metropolis</td><td>20</td><td>1d8+2</td></tr></table><p>*See <a href="../../adventuring/dm-ing/towns.shtml#randomtown">Generating Towns</a>.</p><table class="table" style="width:30em"><tr><td>Conditions</td><td>DC Modifier</td></tr><tr><td>Every three creatures in group being sought</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>Every 24 hours group has been missing/sought</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Tracked group &quot;lies low&quot;</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Tracked group matches community&apos;s primary primary racial demographic*</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Tracked group does not match community&apos;s primary racial demographic*</td><td>-2</td></tr></table><p>*See <a href="../../adventuring/dm-ing/towns.shtml#race">Racial Demographics</a>.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: A character with 5 ranks in Knowledge (local) gains a +2 bonus on the Gather Information check to use this feat.
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: Characters without this feat can use Gather Information to find out about specific individuals, but each check takes 1d4+1 hours and doesn&apos;t allow for effective trailing.

Creatures immune to electricity take no damage from a violated lightning bolt.<br>Each of a creature&apos;s spell-like abilities can be violated twice per day, though the feat does not allow the creature to exceed its normal usage limit for any ability. Thus, if a cornugon chooses to violate its lightning bolt ability, it can use a violate <em>lightning bolt</em> up to two times that day.

        <p>Your attachment to a vanished deity serves as a terrifying example to the most devoted servants of other deities.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Bluff 1 rank, Wedded to History, apostle of the lost background
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you face someone able to cast divine spells you may. As a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, attempt to unnerve him by recounting the fate of your own deity. Make a Bluff check opposed by the target&apos;s Sense Motive check. If you win, the target is shaken for the remainder of the encounter. If your check exceeds the target&apos;s by 5 or more, the target is frightened for one round as well. This is a mind-affecting, language dependent effect.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Volatile mind class feature.

        <p>You have taken a sacred vow to avoid violence against humanoids.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Sacred Vow
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The saving throw DC for spells you cast or other special abilities you use against humanoid or monstrous humanoid targets is increased by +4 if the spell does not deal damage (including ability damage but not nonlethal damage), bestow negative levels, or cause death. Spells affected by this feat include most Abjuration, Enchantment, and Illusion spells (though not <em>phantasmal killer</em>, for example), those few Divination spells that have targets and require saving throws (including <em>detect thoughts</em> and <em>discern lies</em>), and even Necromancy spells such as <em>waves of fatigue</em> and <em>ray of exhaustion</em>. It does not affect most Evocation, Conjuration, and Transmutation spells.<br>The bonus granted by this feat does not stack with the bonus granted by the Spell Focus feat. It affects only saving throw DCs, not caster level checks or other elements of a spell.<br>The benefit of this feat extends to special abilities other than spells that allow a saving throw, but only if the ability does not deal damage and is not dependent on dealing damage. For example, a character with the Stunning Fist feat can increase the saving throw DC to avoid being stunned by +4 if she deals nonlethal damage, rather than regular damage, with her stunning attack. A couatl&apos;s venom would not become more virulent because of this feat, however, because it deals ability damage and requires the couatl to deal hit point damage in order to deliver it.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: To fulfill your vow, you must not cause harm or suffering to humanoid or monstrous humanoid foes. You may not deal real damage or ability damage to such foes through spells or weapons, though you may deal nonlethal damage. You may not target them with death effects, disintegrate, pain effects, or other spells that have the immediate potential to cause death, suffering, or great harm.<br>Your purity is so great that any ally of yours who slays a helpless or defenseless foe within 120 feet of you feels great remorse. Your ally takes +1 morale penalty on his attack rolls for 1 hour per your character level. For each helpless foe slain, the attack penalty increases by 1, to a maximum equal to your character level. The duration of the increased penalty starts from the latest slaying.<br>You may ask your allies to give you an oath that a helpless foe will not be slain. If the oath is sworn, an ally who later breaks the oath takes the penalty for doing so as if you were present. If you leave a helpless foe to be killed by your allies, you have broken your vow. You may ask a defeated creature to give you an oath of surrender or noninterference in exchange for its life. If the creature breaks this oath to you, you can allow your allies to deal with the creature as they see fit without breaking their oaths or your vow of nonviolence.<br>If you intentionally break your vow, you immediately and irrevocably lose the benefit of this feat. You may not take another feat to replace it. If you break your vow as a result of magical compulsion, you lose the benefit of this feat until you perform a suitable penance and receive an <em>atonement</em> spell.

        <p>You have taken a sacred vow to abstain from harming any living creature.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Sacred Vow, Vow of Nonviolence
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This sacred vow grants significant supernatural benefits, but its cost is high.<br>First, you are constantly surrounded by a calming aura to a radius of 20 feet. Creatures within the aura must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + one-half your character level + your Cha modifier) or be affected as by the calm emotions spell. Creatures who leave the aura and reenter it receive new saving throws. A creature that makes a successful saving throw and remains in the aura is unaffected until it leaves the aura and reenters. The aura is a mind-affecting, supernatural compulsion.<br>Second, you gain a +2 natural armor bonus to your AC, a +2 deflection bonus to your AC, and a +2 exalted bonus to your AC. This exalted bonus does not apply to touch attacks and does not hinder incorporeal touch attacks. Brilliant energy weapons, however, do not ignore it. It does not stack with an armor bonus. If you also have the Vow of Poverty feat, the natural armor, deflection, and exalted Armor Class bonuses granted by that feat all increase by +2. If a creature strikes you with a manufactured weapon, the weapon must immediately make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half your character level + your Con modifier) or shatter against your skin, leaving you unharmed.<br>Finally, you gain a +4 exalted bonus on all Diplomacy checks.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: To fulfill your vow, you must not cause harm to any living creature (constructs and undead are not included in this prohibition). You may not deal real damage or ability damage to such creatures through spells or weapons, though you may deal nonlethal damage. You may not target them with death effects, disintegrate, or other spells that have the immediate potential to cause death or great harm. You also may not use non-damaging spells to incapacitate or weaken living foes so that your allies can kill them - if you incapacitate a foe, you must take him prisoner.<br>If you intentionally break your vow, you immediately and irrevocably lose the benefit of this feat. You may not take another feat to replace it. If you break your vow as a result of magical compulsion or otherwise unwittingly you lose the benefit of this feat until you perform a suitable penance and receive an atonement spell. (Characters who have taken a Vow of Peace are known to drink water through a strainer in order to avoid accidentally swallowing, and thereby causing harm to, a small insect.)

You may not, however, borrow a cloak of resistance or any other magic item from a companion fit even a single round, nor may you yourself cast a spell from scroll, wand, or staff.

If you succeed, the affected vermin cannot attack you for 24 hours.<br>Also, you can expend a rebuke undead attempt to rebuke or command vermin. This ability functions like rebuke undead, except that it affects vermin.<br>Finally, you develop horrid glands in your mouth that allow you to spit a wad of toxic fluid. Your glands produce enough poison to spit a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Con bonus (if any). Treat this as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage and forces the target to succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Con modifier) or take 1d4 points of Strength damage. Ten rounds later, the target must succeed on a second save against the same DC or take an additional 1d4 points of Strength damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the target takes 1 point of acid damage from the splash.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: To fulfill your vow, you must not cause harm to any vermin. You may not deal lethal damage or ability damage to such creatures through spells or weapons, though you can deal nonlethal damage. You may not target them with death effects, disintegrate, or other spells that have the immediate potential to cause death or great harm. You also may not use nondamaging spells to incapacitate or weaken vermin so your allies can kill them.<br>In addition, once per week, you must perform a horrid ritual that involves opening yourself to the maddening presence of the Spider Queen. The ritual takes 8 hours, and at the end of this time you take 1d8 points of Wisdom damage. Wisdom damage can be healed normally.<br>If you intentionally break this vow or fail to perform the profane ritual, Lolth finds you wanting. If you have 11 or fewer HD, you immediately transform into a <a href="../../monsters/block/Chwidencha">chwidencha</a>, becoming a scuttling thing with no memory of your former self. If you have 12 or more HD, you immediately become a drider. In both cases, you automatically lose the benefit of this feat and may not select a new one to replace it. If you break your vow because of magical compulsion, or otherwise unintentionally, you lose the benefit of this feat until you perform a suitable penance and receive an <i>atonement</i> spell.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You need only half the amount of sleep per night normal for your species to get a good night&apos;s rest. You can recover from fatigue after 4 hours of complete rest. You can move from exhausted to fatigued after half an hour of complete rest.

        <p>You can activate wands with the speed that an archer fires arrows.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Craft Wand, Master Wand, Quicken Spell, Spellcraft 25 ranks
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You may activate a wand in place of an attack instead of as a standard action. As a full-round action, you could thus make as many wand activations as you could normally make ranged attacks. For instance, if your base attack bonus is +11, you could activate a wand three times as a full-round action. If you also had the Rapid Shot feat, you could activate the wand four times as a full-round action.<br>Each activation after the first costs one additional charge from the wand, cumulative. Thus, the second activation in a round costs 2 extra charges, the third activation 3 extra charges, and so forth.

        <p>Many halflings journey far and wide across the world, spending no more than a few months in one place. You have spent time among the halflings, or you are a halfling yourself. Your exposure to that race&apos;s nomadic way of life has taught you several useful methods of dealing with strangers.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Halfling or 4 ranks in Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You excel in using your words and wit to make your way in the world. This feat grants you three separate abilities.<br><em>Canny Merchant</em>: You can make a Diplomacy check to track down an item that is normally too expensive to be purchased in the town or settlement where you are currently located. The DC of this check is 10 + (the item&apos;s gp cost minus the community&apos;s gp limit, divided by 1,000). If this check succeeds, you learn of a merchant who can supply the item to you. You must still purchase it as normal.<br><em>Intuitive Communication</em>: When you are faced with a creature whose language you do not understand, you can attempt to communicate with it by making a successful Sense Motive check. This check requires that you spend at least 1 minute listening to the creature and watching its gestures and demeanor. The check&apos;s base DC is 20. If the creature is not the same type as you, the DC is 30.<br>With a successful check, you learn the basic gist of the creature&apos;s speech. This ability gives you no special talent to speak the creature&apos;s tongue.<br><em>Social Agility</em>: You can temporarily alter a creature&apos;s attitude toward you. You can use Bluff against an unfriendly or less hostile creature in the same way you use Diplomacy. Using Bluff in this manner is a standard action that takes no special penalties. The target&apos;s attitude remains changed for 1 minute. After this time, it becomes one grade more hostile than where it started for 10 minutes.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Craft Wand, caster level 9th.

        <p>You can channel the magical energy of a wand through your melee attacks.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Use Magic Device 4 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack with a wand, expending one charge to deal 1d6 points of damage to the creature struck. You apply no extra damage to this attack regardless of its source (including sneak attack, favored enemy, and smite bonuses), but you can activate the wand as part of the attack. If the spell cast from the wand is a ray or a targeted spell, the creature struck is the spell&apos;s target (with ray spells hitting automatically). If the spell affects an area or creates a spread, you can designate the spell&apos;s point of origin at any grid intersection point of the creature&apos;s space (but doing so might put you in the affected area). Spells with an effect that does not cover an area (such as the various summon monster spells) cannot be used with a wandstrike attack.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As long as you chant for 3 rounds prior to the start of combat you gain a +2 bonus on your initiative check. In addition, every ally within 30 feet of you who listened to your chanting for the entire time gains a +1 morale bonus on their initiative checks. The +1 bonuses granted by this feat stack with one another (to a maximum of +4), but provide no further benefit to the users of this feat. Thus, a group containing four characters with War Chant grants each member not chanting a +4 morale bonus on initiative checks. Chanting to use this feat requires only a free action to begin and maintain, but the character cannot take any other verbal action while chanting.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per day, when fighting defensively as a standard or full-round action, you take a -3 penalty on all attack rolls in a round and gain a +3 dodge bonus to AC in the same round. When you attain 7th level, your penalty on attack rolls drops to -2 and your dodge bonus increases to +4. When you attain 15th level, your penalty on attack rolls drops to -1 and your dodge bonus increases to +5. This bonus stacks with the bonus to AC granted by the Combat Expertise feat. This benefit is an extraordinary ability.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it.<br>If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each three daily turn or rebuke uses you expend.

        <p>You have a creature of elemental water as an ancestor. Your physical characteristics might vary with the type of elemental creature from which you are descended, but you&apos;re likely to have blue, green, or white coloration. Water blood stems both from planar elemental beings and creatures native to the Material Plane that have a strong affinity for water.<br>Triton spawn often seem well meaning but distant. Characters who can trace their water heritage directly to a being from the Elemental Plane of Water, however, can seem downright cold to others.<br>Water-blooded characters adventure for a number of reasons, but they all seem driven to go forward, go deeper, and overcome any obstacles in their paths. Some deep-seated instinct teaches them to be aware of what&apos;s going on around them, since death can come from any direction underwater. Since fluids are so adaptable, characters with this bloodline are fond of spells that deal with change.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your ancestry gives you a bonus spell known at each spell level, starting at 1st, according to the following list.</p><ul><li>1.

            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If a character takes this feat any time after 1st level and has already learned any of the spells on this list in the class that granted him access to this feat, he gains no additional spells known at those spell levels. This restriction does not apply if he learned any of these spells as a member of another spellcasting class.<br>Characters with Water Bloodline cannot learn or cast spells with the fire descriptor, and all such spells are removed from the spell lists of all their spellcasting classes.

Creatures with immunity to stun effects cannot be affected by this feat.

        <p>Your connection to the Positive Energy Plane and the forces of life itself allow you to turn your familiar into a living vessel of light and energy.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Good alignment, ability to summon a familiar.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As you advance in levels you gain a number of additional abilities when interacting with your familiar. These abilities are in addition to those normally granted to or your familiar. At 1st level, you can, at will, order your familiar to glow as a free action producing light equal to a torch. Beginning at 5th level, you can once per day, touch your familiar and channel a surge of positive energy that heals it for 1d6 points of damage + 1 per class level. This requires move action. At 9th level, you can, once per day, convert your familiar into pure positive energy for 1 minute. During that time, your familiar emits positive energy in a 20-foot-radius emanation. Undead within the emanation take 1 point of damage per round, while living creatures other than you or your familiar gain fast healing 1 while within this aura. After producing this emanation for 1 minute, your familiar disappears into the Positive Energy Plane for 24 hours, during which time you gain no benefits of having a familiar. Activating this ability is standard action. Beginning at 13th level, your familiar&apos;s loyalty and devotion, when coupled with its connection to the Positive Energy Plane, allows it to sacrifice itself to save your life. If able to reach your body within 1 round of your death, your familiar can unleash conflagration of positive energy that consumes it utterly but returns you to life, stable but at -1 hit points. You suffer none of the ill effects that normally come from returning to life (including level loss), but you automatically lose the full 200 XP per class level for the death of your familiar. Due to the special nature of its sacrifice you can summon a new familiar after waiting only one month. At 17th level, you and your familiar gain fast healing 1 as long as you both have at least 1 hit point and are within 5 feet of one another.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: Whenever you cast a spell with the darkness, death, or evil descriptor you lose access to all benefits of this feat for the next 24 hours. A wizard may take Wedded To The Light as a wizard bonus feat.

If given proper training, the animal cohort will willingly serve as your mount, guardian, and companion. (see the description of the <a href="../../charbuild/skills/handle_animal.shtml">Handle Animal skill</a> for more details on training animals.)<br>You can use the Handle Animal skill on your animal cohort as a move action rather than as a standard action, and you gain a +2 bonus on all Handle Animal checks made to direct or influence your animal cohort.<br>Provided the DM gives her approval, at 1st level you can choose from a badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. Like a druid, you can choose more powerful animals as you increase in level. These alternative animal cohorts work like the alternative animal companions available to a druid, but they are available as cohorts later than they are available as animal companions.<br>When selecting an alternative animal cohort, use the list of <a href="../../charbuild/classes/animalcompanion.shtml#alternate">alternative animal companions</a>, but treat yourself as a druid three levels lower than your character level. For example, once you reach 7th level, you can choose an animal cohort off the list of animal companions available to a 4th-level druid.

Although the two abilities are similar, they follow different sets of rules and must be tracked separately. You can only ever have one wild cohort at any given time.<br>Like a druid&apos;s animal companion, your wild cohort improves as you gain experience. Although the animal cohort improves significantly compared to others of its kind, its abilities do not rival those of a druid&apos;s animal companion.</p><table class="table" style="width:30em"><tr><td><strong>Character Level</strong></td><td><strong>Bonus HD</strong></td><td><strong>Natural Armor Adj.</strong></td><td><strong>Str/Dex Bonus </strong></td><td><strong>Bonus Tricks</strong></td><td><strong>Special</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1st-2nd</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td><td>0</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3rd-5th</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td><td>+0</td><td>1</td><td>Evasion</td></tr><tr><td>6th-8th</td><td>+3</td><td>+3</td><td>+1</td><td>2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9th-11th</td><td>+5</td><td>+5</td><td>+2</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>12th-14th</td><td>+7</td><td>+7</td><td>+3</td><td>4</td><td>Devotion</td></tr><tr><td>15th-17th</td><td>+9</td><td>+9</td><td>+4</td><td>5</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>18th-20th</td><td>+11</td><td>+11</td><td>+5</td><td>6</td><td>Improved evasion</td></tr></table><p>

        <p>You can use song or a wind instrument to compel the winds to obey you. The bard who possesses this feat is highly favored aboard a sailing vessel; indeed, a bard who demonstrates the ability to control the wind to some degree is usually given an officer&apos;s position aboard ship.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Bardic music class feature, Perform (sing or wind instruments) 5 ranks.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: By expending a daily bardic music use, you can lull the winds around a single ship into well-tamed gusts. They continue to blow into the sails of the ship as normal for their speed, but their effects on the crew are one stage in intensity less (see <a href="../../adventuring/environment.shtml#windeffects">Wind Effects</a>). Thus, a strong wind affected by this ability continues to propel the ship along as normal for a strong wind, but it only affects the crew as though it were a moderate wind.<br>You can also alter the direction of the wind by one compass point (from north to north-west or north-east, from south-west to west or south, etc.).<br>These effects last as long as the bard continues to per form his bardic music, plus 10 rounds after the music has ended.

        <p>You can use your wings to create a variety of effects.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Flyby Attack, wings and a glide or fly speed.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The Wing Expert feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers.<br><em>Wing Buffet</em>: To use this maneuver, you must charge an opponent. On the round after the charge, you can flutter your wings in a distracting manner while you make a melee attack or attacks against the same opponent you charged. If that opponent fails a DC 20 Reflex save, you gain a +2 bonus for your turn on your melee attack rolls against the distracted opponent. You cannot make a wing buffet again until after you make another charge.<br><em>Wing Defense</em>: To use this maneuver, you must have taken the total defense action. On the round after doing so, if you do not use your wings to fly, you can flutter your wings in such a way as to gain concealment for the round.<br><em>Wing Fan</em>: To use this maneuver, you must have used at least one move action in the previous round to fly or glide at least 30 feet. As a full-round action in the next round, you can use your wings to produce an effect identical to a gust of wind spell with a range of 30 feet. Using this maneuver makes you fatigued. You cannot use this maneuver if you are exhausted.

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to fly
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: This feat allows you to turn at an angle of up to 180 degrees in addition to any other turns you are normally allowed, regardless of your maneuverability. You cannot gain altitude during the round you execute a wingover, but you can dive. For more information, see Tactical Aerial Movement in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER&apos;s Guide.

        <p>You use your wings for more than just flying.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Hover, must have wings, base attack bonus +4.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: The Winged Warrior feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers.</p><p><em>Dustup</em>: To use this maneuver, you must be standing in, or flying no more than 10 feet above, an area with a lot of loose debris. If you flap your wings hard as a move action, the draft creates a hemispherical cloud with a radius of 20 feet. Clear vision within the cloud is limited to 10 feet. Creatures 11 to 20 feet away have concealment. At over 20 feet, creatures have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level) to cast a spell.</p><p><em>Flying Leap</em>: To use this maneuver, you must move a distance greater than your base land speed during the round. If you do, you gain a +4 bonus on Jump, Balance, and Climb checks because your wings give you lift and stabilize you.</p><p><em>Shroud of Feathers</em>: To use this maneuver, you must spend a move action to pull your wings around your body. You cannot be flying during this maneuver. You can then attempt to feint in combat (as described in the <a href="../../charbuild/skills/bluff.shtml">Bluff</a> skill description) as part of your attack, suddenly spreading your wings to reveal your weapon just as it&apos;s about to land a blow. The shroud of feathers maneuver works on a given foe only once per combat.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: The <a href="../../charbuild/feat/Hover" onclick="return popitup(&apos;../../charbuild/feat/Hover&apos;)">Hover</a> feat grants creatures of Large size or larger a bigger dust cloud than that granted with the dustup maneuver. <br>A fighter may select Winged Warrior as one of his fighter bonus feats.

        <p>A skilled warlock can take to the air on wings of dark energy. You have mastered this power and when you assume your shadow form you can strengthen your wings and fly at great speed.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Umbragen race, Shadow Shift, <em>fell flight</em> invocation.
            <br><strong>Region</strong>: Xen&apos;drik (Eberron)

        <p>You can flatten targets with blasts of air from your wings.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Str 13, dragon, fly speed 20, Hover, Power Attack, size Large or larger.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a full-round action, you can hover in place and use your wings to create a blast of air in a cylinder with a radius and height of 10 feet times your age category. The wind blows from the center of your body toward the outside edge at the bottom of the cylinder.<br>The force of the wind depends on your size, as indicated below. For the effects of high winds, see Table 3-4 on page 95 of the Dungeon Master&apos;s Guide.</p><table class="table" style="width:30em"><tr><td>Dragon Size</td><td>Wind Force</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>Severe</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>Windstorm</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>Hurricane</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>Tornado</td></tr></table><p>Because the blast of air only lasts for your turn, creatures ignore the checked effect unless they are airborne (in which case they are blown back 1d6x5 feet).
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You can elect to keep the wind in effect for longer than your current turn. If you do, the wind lasts until your next turn (and you can opt to continue the effect during your next turn). Anyone in or entering the cylinder is affected. Because you are producing a continuous blast of air, the checked effect works normally while the wind lasts (checked creatures cannot move forward against the force of the wind, or they are blown back 1d6x5 feet if airborne).

            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If you have any levels of cleric, these additional domains are not available to your cleric levels, since they are technically paladin spells in this case.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: At 1st level, you may use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Constitution modifier to determine bonus hit points. At each level thereafter, you use your Constitution modifier normally to determine bonus hit points, but you also gain +1 hit point for every point of permanent Wisdom you gain.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: You may take this feat only as a 1st-level character.

            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a standard action, you can cause some or all of your body or an unattended object up to Medium-size that you touch to glow with witchlight, a harmless supernatural flame resembling faerie fire. Witchlight sheds light as a candle and may be pale red, orange, green, blue, or violet. Maintaining witchlight on an object as long as it is within 100 feet of you. This requires concentration, and you can maintain its effect on an object as long as it is within 100 feet of you. This is a supernatural ability.<br>You can use witchlight to outline a creature (such as one under the effects of <em>blur</em>, <em>invisibility</em> and so on), but doing so requires a touch attack (which draws an attack of opportunity from the defender).

            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Favored enemy.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one type of favored enemy, such as undead. You add your favored enemy bonus for that type of creature to saving throws against the standard extraordinary, spell-like, and supernatural abilities of your favored enemy. You do not gain this bonus against other attacks by the creature. For example, a ranger with undead as a favored enemy would gain his favored enemy bonus on saves against a vampire&apos;s domination ability but not to saves against the poison on its dagger or any saves against spells it cast from class levels. This saving throw bonus applies to all secondary effects of the favored enemy&apos;s attacks, so the ranger would also get his favored enemy bonus on the Fortitude save to remove a negative level caused by the vampire&apos;s energy drain ability.

If you win the opposed check, your foe turns her attention to you, and each of your allies who are in position to give you a flanking bonus can make an attack of opportunity against that foe.</p><p><em>Drive Back</em>: To use this maneuver, you and at least one ally must threaten the same foe, and at least one of those allies must use the aid another action to assist your attack roll. You make a melee attack as a full-round action. If you hit, you make a free bull rush attempt without moving into the defender&apos;s space or provoking attacks of opportunity. Resolve the bull rush normally, except that you add the damage your attack dealt as a bonus on the Strength check you make to resolve the bull rush.

        <p>You have learned a few of the words that were spoken to create the world.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Int 15, Cha 15, base Will save bonus +5.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can use the <em>Words of Creation</em> to enhance bardic music, to help cast good spells and create good magic items, and to enhance the process of creation (see <a href="../../magic/items/word_creation.shtml" class="spell">Words of Creation</a>).
            <br><strong>Normal</strong>: A nonevil creature that tries to utter the <em>Words of Creation</em> without learning them properly is affected as by a <a href="../../magic/spell/Feeblemind" onclick="return popitup(&apos;../../magic/spell/Feeblemind&apos;)" class="spell">feeblemind</a> spell, while an evil character is struck dead. Fortunately, it is impossible to make someone speak the <em>Words of Creation</em> against his will, because their pronunciation is so exacting.

        <p>You have taken a vile green Kyuss worm into your own body and bound yourself to its power. 
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Living creature, host a living Kyuss worm.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: Successfully hosting a Kyuss worm requires a special binding ritual. The ritual requires 4 hours of uninterrupted meditation, 500 gp in special materials, and a living Kyuss worm. At the end of the ceremony, you must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or die. If you fail the saving throw, you rise as a spawn of Kyuss within 1d6+4 rounds. If you succeed at the saving throw, you can add the following spells to your class spell list:</p><ul><li>2nd - <em>path of worms</em></li><li>3rd - <em>consume the parasite, the worm within</em></li><li>4th - <em>mindworms</em></li><li>5th - <em>servant of the green corruption</em></li><li>7th - <em>extrude wormswarm</em></li></ul><p>You must still learn and prepare these spells according to the normal spellcasting rules for your class.<br>The worm can be removed only by casting one of the following spells: dispel evil, heal, remove curse, or remove disease in a hallowed area, or by casting consume the parasite. If the worm is removed, you cannot cast these spells and lose any of these spells that you may have prepared. You must repeat the binding ritual to regain this feat&apos;s benefits.
            <br><strong>Special</strong>: If you die with a living Kyuss worm inside you, you rise as a spawn of Kyuss within 1d6+4 rounds. As a spawn of Kyuss, you exist only to spread the corrupting power of Kyuss and have no free will of your own(meaning that the spawn of Kyuss becomes a monster under the DM&apos;s control).

        <h1>Words of Draconic Power</h1>
        <p><strong>Type</strong>: Ceremony

        <p>You tap into the great tradition of draconic magic to enhance the words of your allies. 
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks, Speak Language (Draconic) 
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain access to ceremonies based on your ranks in Knowledge (religion). Each ceremony requires 5 minutes, but their forms vary as described below. Each ceremony can affect up to six individuals, and the effects last for 24 hours. <br><em>Ancient Tongue (4 ranks):</em> Using a tindertwig, you burn dragon runes onto a piece of bread (one per participant) and place it on the participants tongue, thereby sharing your knowledge of the ancient language of dragons. Each participant gains the ability to speak and understand the Draconic language. <br><em>Potent Words (8 ranks):</em> You write mystic incantations on a flask or alchemist&apos;s fire (one per participant), making it safe to consume. Each participant then drinks the contents of the flask. When a participant casts a language-dependent spell, his caster level is increased by 1. Participants also gain a +1 bonus on saves against language-dependent spells. <br><em>Arcane Symbols (14 ranks):</em> You scribe a single draconic rune on a pearl worth at least 1,000 gp (one per participant), which is consumed by the participant. At any one time during the next 24 hours, the participant can choose to activate the ceremony&apos;s power as an immediate action. This has one of two effects, chosen by the participant. <br>If the character is being subjected to a <em>power word</em> spell, he can treat his current hit points as twice their actual number for the purpose of determining the effect of the spell. For example, a character with 55 hit points who activated this ability in response to a <em>power word kill</em> spell would be Unaffected by the spell (since he would effectively have 101 hit points.)<br>If the character is capable of casting a <em>power word</em> spell (that is, he either has such a spell prepared, or he knows one and has a spell slot available to cast it) he can cast that power word spell with no additional action required. Doing this expends the prepared spell or spell slot as normal.

        <p>Because you have studied the cruel arts of the Athalantan magelords of old, you know how to cast spells that cause terrible, bleeding wounds.
            <br><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Knowledge (history) 4 ranks, Empower Spell.
            <br><strong>Benefit</strong>: When affected by this feat, a spell that deals damage to a creature also inflicts a bleeding wound that does not heal normally. On each subsequent round, the victim loses 1 hit point at the beginning of your turn. The continuing hit point loss can be stopped with a Heal check (DC equal to the spell&apos;s save DC, or the save DC it would otherwise have in the case of a spell with no save), a cure spell, or a heal spell.<br>You cannot apply this feat to a spell that does not deal damage (such as <em>charm person</em> or <em>baleful polymorph</em>).<br>A wounding spell occupies a spell slot two levels higher than the spell&apos;s actual level.
