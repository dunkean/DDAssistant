       <h2 id="Deathless">Deathless Type</h2>
       <p>Deathless describes creatures that have died but returned to a kind of spiritual life. They are similar in many ways to both living creatures and undead. However, while undead represent a mockery of life and a violation of the natural order of life and death, the deathless merely stave off the inevitability of death for a short time in order to accomplish a righteous purpose. While undead draw their power from the Negative Energy plane, the deathless are strongly tied the Positive Energy plane, the birthplace of all souls. In fact, the deathless are little more than disincarnate souls, sometimes wrapped in material flesh, often incorporeal and hardly more substantial than a soul in its purest state.</p>

Immune to damage to its physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution) as well as fatigue and exhaustion effects. Unlike undead, the deathless are subject to energy drain. Like living creatures, deathless are harmed by negative energy and healed by positive energy</li>
           <li>Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save, except for energy drain attacks, effects that also work on objects, and harmless effects.</li>
           <li>Cannot use the run action.</li>

Evil casters can be stunned by overwhelming auras of deathless creatures as good casters can be stunned by overwhelming undead auras. Use "undead" line in the <i>detect evil</i> spell description when deathless are in the area of <i>detect good</i> spell.

Spells that have greater than normal effect against undead creatures - including <i>chill touch, magic stone, searing light, sunbeam, sunburst</i>, and <i>wall of fire</i> - do not have these enhanced effects against deathless creatures.
